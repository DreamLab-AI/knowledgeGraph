  ## Definition

  **3D asset creation** is the branch of asset creation concerned specifically with spatial content: the meshes, materials, rigs, and animations that populate games, films, XR experiences, simulations, and digital twins. The 3D qualification matters—unlike audio, code, or flat imagery, a 3D asset must satisfy geometric and runtime constraints simultaneously. It needs clean topology for deformation, sensible UV layouts for [[Texture Mapping]], physically based materials that respond correctly to lighting, and polygon budgets and levels of detail matched to its target platform, whether that is a film render farm or a standalone VR headset.

  The traditional pipeline runs from concept art through blocking, high-resolution sculpting, retopology, UV unwrapping, texturing and material authoring, rigging, and animation, using [[3D Modelling]] packages such as Blender, Maya, ZBrush, and Substance. Alongside manual authorship sit capture-based routes—photogrammetry, LiDAR scanning, and Gaussian splatting reconstruct real objects and places—and [[Procedural Generation]], where rule-based tools like Houdini synthesise terrain, buildings, and foliage at scales no team could hand-model.

  Generative AI is the newest entrant: text-to-3D and image-to-3D systems (built on diffusion models, score distillation, and large reconstruction models) now produce textured meshes in seconds. Their output typically still needs remeshing and material clean-up before production use, so the practical effect so far has been to compress ideation and previsualisation rather than replace the pipeline. The output in every route is a [[Digital Asset]] that must be versioned, licensed, and optimised for its destination engine.

  ## Current Landscape

  Demand is driven by real-time 3D's spread beyond entertainment into product configurators, architectural visualisation, industrial simulation, and virtual production. Asset interchange is consolidating around glTF for runtime delivery and OpenUSD for pipeline interchange, with the Alliance for OpenUSD (Pixar, Adobe, Apple, Autodesk, NVIDIA) formalising the standard. Marketplaces—Sketchfab, Fab, TurboSquid—and scan libraries such as Quixel Megascans have made high-quality stock assets a substitute for bespoke work in many productions.

  The pressing questions are economic and legal rather than technical. AI-assisted generation compresses junior artist tasks, shifting studio demand towards art direction, optimisation, and technical art skills; meanwhile the provenance and licensing of training data for generative 3D models remains contested. On the technical frontier, the gap between offline and real-time quality continues to narrow as engines adopt virtualised geometry (Nanite-style micropolygon streaming) and neural compression, letting film-grade assets ship in interactive titles with far less manual optimisation.
