- ### Definition
  - 3D Scene Reconstruction is the task of building a complete geometric and photometric model of an environment from sensor observations. It integrates [[Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping]] for online incremental reconstruction, [[Structure-from-Motion]] for camera pose estimation from image collections, and [[Multi-View Stereo]] for dense depth recovery. The resulting models — expressed as point clouds, surface meshes, volumetric fields, or neural representations such as [[NeRF]] and [[Gaussian Splatting]] — serve as the geometric foundation for [[Digital Twin Creation]], [[3D Perception]] systems, and [[AR Registration]] in spatial computing applications.

- ### Relationships
  - 3D Scene Reconstruction uses [[Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping]] for real-time incremental reconstruction, [[Structure-from-Motion]] to register camera poses across image sets, and [[Multi-View Stereo]] for dense depth recovery. It enables [[Digital Twin Creation]] by converting physical spaces into digital representations, supports [[3D Perception]] through rich scene models, and enables [[AR Registration]] by providing accurate world geometry. The process is closely related to [[3D Scanning]] hardware workflows, and to emerging neural methods including [[NeRF]] and [[Gaussian Splatting]].

- ### Content
  - Systematic scene reconstruction research emerged alongside early computer vision in the 1970s–1980s, with the development of stereo vision and structure-from-motion algorithms. The KinectFusion system (Microsoft Research, 2011) was a landmark achievement demonstrating dense real-time TSDF volumetric fusion on a consumer GPU, enabling live reconstruction from a moving depth camera. This inspired subsequent work on large-scale reconstruction (ElasticFusion, TSDF++, InfiniTAM) that addressed memory and drift limitations.

  - Modern pipelines are divided into offline batch reconstruction and online real-time methods. Offline systems such as COLMAP and OpenMVS process image collections through structure-from-motion followed by multi-view stereo, producing high-quality meshes suitable for film and digital heritage. Online systems operate on live sensor streams, maintaining probabilistic models of scene geometry that are updated as new observations arrive. Loop closure detection corrects accumulated drift by recognising previously visited locations and applying graph optimisation.

  - Neural reconstruction methods have transformed the state of the art since 2020. NeRF learns a continuous volumetric radiance field from posed images, yielding photo-realistic novel-view synthesis from arbitrary camera positions. Gaussian splatting (2023) represents scenes as collections of 3D Gaussians with learnable colour and opacity, enabling real-time rendering while preserving reconstruction quality. These methods are displacing classical mesh-based pipelines for visual-effects and spatial computing workflows that prioritise appearance fidelity over explicit geometric access.

  - Through 2024–2025, scene reconstruction is integrating with semantic understanding: systems now simultaneously recover geometry and assign semantic labels to regions, enabling navigation-ready scene graphs. Foundation-model-guided priors improve reconstruction quality in occluded and low-texture regions. Reconstruction from moving video on mobile devices (using LiDAR-equipped smartphones) enables widespread capture without specialised equipment. Industrial digital-twin platforms are standardising on neural reconstruction pipelines for rapid site capture and ongoing change detection.
