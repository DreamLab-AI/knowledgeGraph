- ### Definition
  - 5G Connectivity refers to the live service capability provided to devices and applications through a deployed [[5G Network]], including the radio bearer between user equipment and gNB base stations, quality-of-service (QoS) flows for differentiated traffic handling, and network slice selection for application-specific service-level guarantees. It delivers [[Low Latency]] below 10 ms for most deployments (and below 1 ms in URLLC configurations), enabling cloud-rendered [[XR Applications]], [[IoT Infrastructure]] for massive device populations, and mission-critical industrial communications. [[MultiAccessEdgeComputing]] at the 5G network edge brings compute resources closer to devices, further reducing effective latency.

- ### Relationships
  - 5G Connectivity enables [[XR Applications]] requiring high-bandwidth, low-latency wireless links, supports [[IoT Infrastructure]] at scale, and delivers [[Low Latency]] critical for real-time control. It uses [[5G Network]] infrastructure, [[MultiAccessEdgeComputing]] for edge placement of compute, and [[Network Function Virtualization]] in the core. It is closely related to [[Guaranteed Bandwidth]] through QoS mechanisms, [[Latency]] as its primary performance metric, and [[3GPP]] as its standards source.

- ### Content
  - 5G Connectivity as a service offering became commercially available in 2019 when operators including SK Telecom, Verizon, and Vodafone launched initial 5G NR services in major cities. Early non-standalone deployments used 4G LTE core networks, limiting the achievable latency and network slicing benefits to radio layer improvements. Standalone 5G, with a native 5G Core, began rolling out from 2020, enabling the full service architecture including per-slice QoS and network exposure APIs.

  - The service quality dimensions of 5G connectivity are defined in 3GPP Release 15+ standardised QoS Identifier (5QI) tables, which specify target delay budgets, packet error rates, and throughput priorities for different traffic classes. URLLC traffic (5QI values 82–85) targets 1 ms air-interface latency with 99.9999% reliability, suitable for industrial control loops. eMBB traffic (5QI 1–9) targets high throughput for video streaming and XR. Network slicing allows operators to partition capacity and present separate connectivity services to enterprise customers with contractually guaranteed performance parameters.

  - The practical impact of 5G connectivity is most visible in fixed wireless access (providing home broadband via 5G radio rather than fixed fibre), enterprise private networks for Industry 4.0 manufacturing and logistics, and emerging cloud XR applications where headset rendering is offloaded to edge servers. V2X (vehicle-to-everything) communications use 5G's low latency for cooperative driving applications. Smart city infrastructure connects environmental sensors, traffic management systems, and public safety networks over 5G.

  - In 2024–2025, 5G connectivity is maturing from coverage-building to capability-differentiation. Network slicing is being commercialised by operators for vertical industries; neutral-host deployments extend indoor 5G coverage; and AI-driven radio resource management (introduced in 3GPP Release 18) optimises spectrum usage dynamically. XR headset manufacturers are partnering with operators to validate split-rendering architectures that exploit 5G edge compute, targeting sub-20 ms total glass-to-glass latency for immersive spatial experiences. Satellite-terrestrial integration under Release 17 NTN specifications extends 5G connectivity to remote and maritime environments.
