3D rendering is the computational process of generating a two-dimensional image or animation from a three-dimensional scene description by simulating the interaction of light with surfaces, materials, and geometry. It encompasses techniques ranging from real-time rasterization used in interactive applications to physically-based ray tracing and path tracing used for photorealistic offline production. The pipeline converts geometric primitives, shader programs, texture maps, and lighting data into final pixel colours via a GPU compute pipeline or software renderer. Contemporary rendering also incorporates neural methods such as Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting, as well as AI-driven upscaling and denoising, blurring the boundary between classical computer graphics and machine learning.

### Overview

- 3D rendering is a foundational technology in digital content creation, games, film VFX, architectural visualisation, scientific simulation, and immersive XR experiences. Its core challenge is computationally reproducing the way photons interact with surfaces: how they are emitted by light sources, reflected or absorbed by materials, scattered through volumes, and ultimately focused by a virtual camera onto a pixel grid. Two dominant paradigms address this challenge at different points on the fidelity-versus-speed spectrum:
  - **Rasterization** — projects geometry onto the screen plane and fills pixels with colour computed by shader programs. Extremely fast; powers virtually all real-time games and interactive 3D applications.
  - **Ray/Path Tracing** — simulates individual light rays, enabling correct global illumination, soft shadows, reflections, refractions, and caustics. Computationally expensive; traditionally used for offline film production.
- Hardware-accelerated ray tracing (RT cores, BVH traversal) and neural upscaling are rapidly closing the gap, enabling near-photorealistic quality at real-time frame rates.

### Key Components

- **[[Render Pipeline]]** — the ordered sequence of programmable and fixed-function GPU stages: input assembly, vertex shading, primitive assembly, rasterization, fragment/pixel shading, and output merging.
- **[[Pixel Shader]] / Fragment Shader** — evaluates per-pixel colour, incorporating [[Texture Mapping]], BRDF lighting models, and shadow lookups.
- **[[Compute Shader]]** — general-purpose GPU kernel used for screen-space ambient occlusion, particle simulation, ray marching, and denoising.
- **[[Depth Buffer]] (Z-buffer)** — per-pixel depth storage that resolves visibility without sorting geometry.
- **[[Scene Graph]]** — hierarchical data structure that organises 3D scene objects, transforms, and material bindings for efficient CPU-side culling and draw-call assembly.
- **[[Lighting Model]]** — mathematical description of surface reflectance: Blinn-Phong, Cook-Torrance BRDF, Disney's principled BSDF, or volumetric phase functions for participating media.
- **[[Global Illumination]]** — simulation of indirect light bouncing between surfaces, achieved via path tracing, radiosity, light probes, irradiance caching, or screen-space approximations such as SSAO and SSGI.
- **[[Anti-Aliasing]]** — techniques (MSAA, TAA, DLSS, FSR, XeSS) that remove staircase artefacts from undersampled edges and fine geometric detail.
- **[[Level of Detail]] (LOD)** — substituting lower-resolution geometry meshes or impostor billboards at distance to reduce GPU load.
- **[[Shader Programming]]** — authored in GLSL, HLSL, MSL, or SPIR-V, allowing artists and engineers to define arbitrary per-vertex and per-pixel programs.

### Mechanisms

#### Real-Time Rasterization Pipeline

- Application stage (CPU): frustum culling, batching, draw-call submission via [[Vulkan]], DirectX 12, Metal, or WebGPU.
- Vertex stage (GPU): MVP matrix transform from model space to clip space; skinning for skeletal animation.
- Primitive assembly and clipping: assembles triangles; clips against the view frustum.
- Rasterization: triangle coverage testing; generates screen-space fragments with interpolated attributes (UVs, normals, tangents).
- Fragment stage: executes [[Pixel Shader]] to sample textures, evaluate [[Lighting Model]], and output HDR colour.
- Post-processing: tone mapping, bloom, depth-of-field, temporal anti-aliasing, motion blur, and chromatic aberration.

#### Ray Tracing and Path Tracing

- Primary ray generation: one ray per pixel from the virtual camera.
- BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy) traversal: accelerates ray-triangle intersection tests across millions of polygons.
- Material evaluation: BSDF sampling determines reflected or refracted ray direction and weight.
- Russian roulette termination and next-event estimation: statistical techniques to achieve unbiased convergence with bounded ray depth.
- [[Path Tracing]] yields unbiased [[Global Illumination]] but requires many samples per pixel; Monte Carlo denoising (OptiX AI, Intel Open Image Denoise) reduces noise at low sample counts.

#### Neural and Hybrid Methods

- **[[Neural Radiance Field]] (NeRF)**: volumetric neural scene representation trained from multi-view images; differentiable rendering enables view synthesis without explicit geometry.
- **[[3D Gaussian Splatting]]**: point-cloud of oriented Gaussians rasterized with alpha blending; faster training and real-time inference than NeRF.
- **AI upscaling** (DLSS 3, FSR 3, XeSS): convolutional or transformer-based super-resolution reconstructs high-resolution frames from lower-resolution rasterized input, dramatically reducing GPU load.
- **[[Differentiable Rendering]]**: gradients flow back through the render equation, enabling inverse rendering (recovering 3D scene parameters from images) and training generative 3D models.

### Applications / Use Cases

- **Games and Interactive Media** — Real-time rasterization with hybrid ray tracing powers titles on PC and consoles, targeting 60–120 fps at 4K. PBR material workflows (Unreal Engine, Unity) standardise asset authoring.
- **Film and Animation VFX** — Offline [[Path Tracing]] (Arnold, RenderMan, Cycles, Manuka) produces photorealistic imagery for feature films and commercials with multi-hour per-frame budgets.
- **Architectural and Product Visualisation** — Interactive GPU path tracers (NVIDIA Omniverse, Chaos V-Ray RT) provide real-time design feedback for architects and industrial designers.
- **[[Virtual Reality]] and [[Augmented Reality]]** — Stereo rendering at 90–120 fps per eye for HMDs; [[Foveated Rendering]] concentrates compute at the gaze point detected by eye tracking.
- **Scientific and Medical Visualisation** — Volume rendering of CT/MRI data using ray marching and transfer functions; molecular visualisation for structural biology.
- **Autonomous Vehicles** — Synthetic data generation for training perception models; photorealistic simulation of sensor streams (cameras, LiDAR) via differentiable renderers.
- **Digital Twins and [[Spatial Computing]]** — Persistent, physically accurate 3D models of real-world environments rendered in real time for industrial monitoring and urban planning.
- **Generative AI Content Pipelines** — Text-to-3D and image-to-3D systems use [[Differentiable Rendering]] and Score Distillation Sampling to optimise 3D representations guided by 2D diffusion models.

### Current Landscape (2026)

- Radiance-field rendering has gone mainstream: 3D Gaussian Splatting (Kerbl et al., SIGGRAPH 2023) now trains a scene in 10-30 minutes on a single RTX 5080 and rasterises at 120+ FPS in 4K, decisively displacing slower ray-marched NeRFs for real-time reconstruction while NeRFs retain edges in memory-efficiency and cross-scene priors.
- Standardisation arrived in 2026: Khronos announced the KHR_gaussian_splatting extension for glTF 2.0 in February 2026 (release-candidate stage, full ratification expected Q2 2026), while the Alliance for OpenUSD advances a Particle Fields schema for splats and OGC 3D Tiles 2.0 adds Gaussian splats as a first-class tile type.
- Real-time path tracing became production-grade: NVIDIA's RTX Kit (v2025.3) and the NvRTX 5.6 branch of Unreal Engine bring RTX Mega Geometry (ray tracing of full-quality Nanite geometry) and ReSTIR PT; the November 2025 "Bonsai" demo hit 60 FPS at 2160p (upscaled from 1080p) but required an RTX 5090.
- Neural rendering reshaped the pipeline: DLSS 4 added Multi Frame Generation (up to three generated frames per rendered frame on GeForce RTX 50-series) plus a transformer-based super-resolution and ray-reconstruction model, and RTX Neural Shaders now train tiny networks inside shaders for texture compression and material evaluation.
- Engine-level splat support shipped natively: Unity 6.2 and Unreal Engine 5.6 both include native Gaussian runtimes, with NVIDIA Omniverse carrying USD-native splats for simulation-grade digital twins.
- Research pushed splats past their early limits with relightable Gaussians (GS-IR, Relightable 3DGS), dynamic/4D temporal splats, animatable Gaussian avatars from Meta and Microsoft, and generative 3DGS from single prompts (Luma Genie, Tencent Hunyuan3D); optimisation work such as Faster-GS (CVPR 2026) cut training to under two minutes with ~5x speed-ups and 30% less VRAM.
- Capital and open challenges: World Labs raised roughly $1bn in February 2026 (backers including NVIDIA, AMD, Autodesk) to pursue spatial intelligence, but format fragmentation (PLY still dominant pre-ratification), relighting and material decomposition, level-of-detail streaming for large scenes on constrained devices, and editability of learned primitives remain unsolved frontiers.
