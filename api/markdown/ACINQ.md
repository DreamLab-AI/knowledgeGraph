- ### Definition
  - ACINQ (pronounced "a-cinq", French for "at five") is a Paris-based Bitcoin technology company that designs, builds, and operates [[Lightning Network]] infrastructure. The company is best known for the [[Eclair]] node implementation — a production-grade [[Lightning Network]] daemon written in [[Scala Programming Language]] — and the [[Phoenix Wallet]], a self-custodial mobile [[Bitcoin]] wallet that communicates exclusively over the Lightning protocol. ACINQ operates one of the best-connected public [[Routing Node]] instances on the network, contributing significant [[Channel Liquidity]] and serving as a trampoline hub for mobile clients that cannot maintain a full routing table. Through its participation in the [[Basis of Lightning Technology]] (BOLT) specification process, ACINQ has helped define protocol features including [[Trampoline Routing]], [[Splicing]], and [[BOLT 12]] offers.

- ### Overview
  - ACINQ was founded in 2014 in Paris, France, originally focused on [[Bitcoin]] tooling. As the [[Lightning Network]] white paper emerged (Poon & Dryja, 2015) the company pivoted to become one of its three flagship node implementation teams, alongside Lightning Labs ([[LND]]) and Blockstream ([[Core Lightning]]).
  - The company's dual mission is (1) to provide a robust open-source [[Lightning Network]] implementation suitable for routing nodes and infrastructure operators, and (2) to make [[Lightning Network]] payments accessible to non-technical end-users through Phoenix, its consumer-facing wallet.
  - ACINQ operates ACINQ.fr, a publicly advertised super-node with a large number of open channels, which acts as a hub to which Phoenix wallet users connect by default, enabling [[Trampoline Routing]] — a technique ACINQ invented and proposed as a BOLT extension to delegate path-finding computation from resource-constrained mobile devices to well-connected routing nodes.

- ### Key Components
  - #### Eclair
    - The flagship open-source Lightning node implementation, written in [[Scala Programming Language]] using the Akka actor framework.
    - Targets server-side routing node operators and institutional Lightning infrastructure.
    - Supports all core BOLT features: [[HTLC]] forwarding, [[Onion Routing]] (layered [[Sphinx Routing]]), [[Payment Channel]] lifecycle, and cooperative/force-close flows.
    - Implements [[Trampoline Routing]], [[Splicing]], [[Anchor Outputs]], and [[BOLT 12]] offers.
    - Exposes a JSON-RPC API and is used as the backend powering the Phoenix wallet's server-side component.
  - #### Phoenix Wallet
    - A [[Non-Custodial Wallet]] iOS and Android application connecting to ACINQ's node as a trampoline hub.
    - Users retain control of their private keys; channels are opened on demand using [[Splicing]] so a single channel can expand or contract without on-chain closure.
    - Introduced the concept of a "zero-configuration" Lightning experience: inbound [[Channel Liquidity]] is provisioned automatically via a "dual-funded channel" or [[Splicing]] mechanism.
    - Operates over [[Tor]] for enhanced privacy on supported platforms.
  - #### Trampoline Routing
    - An ACINQ-pioneered protocol extension allowing a mobile [[Lightning Network]] node to delegate route calculation to one or more intermediate "trampoline" nodes.
    - Reduces the requirement for clients to maintain a full [[Gossip Protocol]] routing table, critical for battery-constrained mobile devices.
    - Preserves payment privacy through nested [[Onion Routing]] packets.
  - #### Splicing
    - A protocol feature enabling the resizing of [[Payment Channel]] capacity — both increasing and decreasing — via a single on-chain transaction, while keeping the channel live for routing during the splice confirmation.
    - ACINQ implemented splicing in Eclair and Phoenix before it was widely supported across implementations.

- ### Applications and Use Cases
  - **Mobile [[Bitcoin]] Payments** — Phoenix provides a user-friendly entry point to the [[Lightning Network]] without requiring users to manage channel balances manually, targeting everyday retail and remittance use cases.
  - **Institutional Routing Infrastructure** — Eclair is deployed by exchanges, payment processors, and [[Bitcoin Layer 2]] service providers that need a reliable, high-throughput [[Routing Node]].
  - **Developer Tooling** — The `eclair-core` library exposes Lightning primitives for integration into third-party applications, making ACINQ a building block in the broader Lightning developer ecosystem.
  - **[[Micropayment]] Streaming** — The sub-satoshi precision of Lightning [[HTLC]] settlements enables value-streaming applications such as pay-per-second media or API metering; ACINQ's infrastructure serves as a routing backbone for these flows.
  - **Cross-border Remittance** — Phoenix's fee-transparent model (swap-in/swap-out via [[Splicing]]) makes it suitable for low-value international transfers that are uneconomical on-chain.
  - **Proof-of-Concept for Protocol Innovation** — ACINQ uses Phoenix as a live testbed for new BOLT features before they are standardised, meaning millions of Phoenix users act as a real-world deployment surface for emerging Lightning protocol capabilities.

- ### Mechanisms
  - **[[HTLC]] (Hashed Time-Locked Contract)** — The atomic swap primitive used to route payments through multi-hop [[Payment Channel]] paths; each hop holds funds conditionally pending a cryptographic pre-image reveal within a time window.
  - **[[Onion Routing]] / [[Sphinx Routing]]** — Payments traverse the network inside layered encrypted packets; each routing node decrypts only the layer addressed to it, preserving sender and recipient privacy.
  - **[[Channel Liquidity]] Management** — ACINQ's node deploys automated liquidity management: closing depleted channels, rebalancing via circular payments, and using [[Splicing]] to top up without channel closure.
  - **[[Gossip Protocol]]** — Lightning nodes broadcast channel announcements and updates; ACINQ's node aggregates this [[Peer-to-Peer Network]] gossip to maintain a network-wide routing graph used by the Eclair path-finder.
  - **[[Anchor Outputs]]** — A channel construction technique (adopted after SegWit) that allows fee-bumping of commitment transactions post-broadcast via Child-Pays-for-Parent (CPFP), improving safety under fee-market volatility.
  - **[[BOLT 12]] Offers** — A reusable, static payment descriptor format that replaces single-use Lightning invoices; ACINQ has been an early implementer and advocate.

- ### Standards & Context
  - ACINQ participates actively in the **BOLT (Basis of Lightning Technology)** specification process, which is the de-facto standards body for the [[Lightning Network]] protocol.
  - Key BOLTs relevant to ACINQ's work:
    - **BOLT 1** — Base protocol message framing.
    - **BOLT 2** — [[Payment Channel]] establishment and operation.
    - **BOLT 4** — [[Sphinx Routing]] / [[Onion Routing]] packet format.
    - **BOLT 7** — [[Gossip Protocol]] for peer and channel discovery.
    - **BOLT 11** — Invoice encoding (the widely used `lnbc...` format).
    - **BOLT 12** — Offers protocol (reusable static invoices), championed by ACINQ and others.
  - The [[Bitcoin]] base layer provides settlement guarantees via [[Bitcoin Proof-of-Work Protocol]] consensus; ACINQ's stack relies on [[SegWit]] transaction outputs (P2WSH / P2TR) for channel script constructs.
  - As a French company (SAS legal form), ACINQ operates under EU financial regulation; self-custodial wallet design is partly motivated by regulatory positioning to avoid acting as a custodian.
  - The Lightning Network as a whole operates without a central standards organisation; BOLTs are maintained collaboratively by ACINQ, Lightning Labs, Blockstream, and independent contributors via GitHub.
