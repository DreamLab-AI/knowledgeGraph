- ### Definition
  - 6DoF Tracking provides complete six-degree-of-freedom pose estimation — three translational axes (surge, sway, heave) and three rotational axes (pitch, yaw, roll) — for a device or object operating in 3D space. In XR systems, it replaces the three-degree-of-freedom (3DoF) orientation-only tracking of early headsets with full spatial positioning, enabling the wearer to physically walk through a virtual environment that updates correctly as they move. The capability is implemented through [[Sensor Fusion]] of [[IMU]] data (high-rate inertial signals) with visual odometry from on-device cameras, SLAM algorithms that build a map of the environment, and optionally external tracking systems.

- ### Relationships
  - 6DoF Tracking uses [[Sensor Fusion]] to combine [[IMU]] inertial measurements with camera-based visual estimates, and relies on [[Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping]] for map-referenced pose estimation. It enables [[XR Applications]] by grounding virtual content in physical space, supports [[AR Registration]] for accurate hologram placement, and feeds [[3D Perception]] systems with device pose information. It is closely related to [[Pose Estimation]] as a superset capability, [[Camera Tracking]] for the visual component, and [[Depth Sensing]] as an optional enhancement for robustness.

- ### Content
  - The concept of six-degrees-of-freedom tracking predates consumer XR: industrial motion capture systems such as Polhemus electromagnetic trackers (developed in the 1970s) and optical marker-based systems were used for engineering simulation, medical training, and film visual effects. Early VR headsets of the 1990s (Virtuality Group, CAVE installations) used mechanical arm tracking or overhead camera arrays, which were accurate but expensive and spatially constrained. The practical democratisation of 6DoF tracking began with the Oculus Rift CV1 (2016), which introduced external lighthouse/constellation tracking using computer vision on passive IR markers.

  - Modern inside-out 6DoF tracking (where cameras are on the device rather than external fixtures) relies on SLAM algorithms that simultaneously estimate camera pose and build a feature-point map of the environment. The Extended Kalman Filter or factor-graph optimisation fuse visual feature tracking with IMU pre-integration to produce low-latency pose estimates at display rates (90–120 Hz). Depth cameras, structured light, and time-of-flight sensors provide dense geometry for plane detection, occlusion handling, and obstacle avoidance. Apple Vision Pro (2024) uses 12 cameras, 6 microphones, and 5 sensors with eye and hand tracking for a reference implementation of consumer-grade inside-out 6DoF.

  - Performance requirements for comfortable XR are stringent: motion-to-photon latency (the delay from physical movement to display update) must remain below 20 ms to avoid motion sickness, requiring the entire tracking, rendering, and display pipeline to operate within that budget. Reprojection techniques (asynchronous timewarp, asynchronous spacewarp) extrapolate the most recent pose estimate to correct for the final few milliseconds, but accurate 6DoF tracking remains the primary latency bottleneck. Predictive algorithms using Kalman filtering and learning-based methods anticipate future pose from motion history to pre-render frames.

  - In 2024–2025, 6DoF tracking is standard on all major standalone XR platforms (Meta Quest, Apple Vision Pro, Pico, HTC Vive XR Elite). Accuracy improvements are coming from neural visual odometry — deep-learned feature matching replacing hand-crafted ORB/SIFT descriptors — and from tighter integration with semantic scene understanding that provides stable anchor points even in texture-poor environments. Persistent AR anchors that survive headset removal and environment changes are enabling shared spatial experiences across sessions and devices. Robotics is increasingly adopting the same SLAM-based 6DoF tracking stack for mobile manipulation and autonomous navigation.
