- ### Definition
  - A **5G Network** is the complete end-to-end fifth-generation mobile telecommunications system, encompassing a [[5G New Radio]] radio access network (RAN), a cloud-native [[5G Core]] built on a service-based architecture, and the backhaul/fronthaul [[Transport Network]] that interconnects them. It is defined by [[3GPP]] across Release 15 through Release 18 (5G-Advanced) and supports three canonical service classes — enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC), and massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC) — enabling a single physical deployment to simultaneously serve broadband consumers, latency-critical industrial controllers, and billions of [[IoT Infrastructure]] devices. [[Network Slicing]] and [[Network Function Virtualization]] allow the 5G Core to be decomposed into independently scalable software functions running on [[Cloud-Native Architecture]] platforms, representing a fundamental break from the monolithic Evolved Packet Core of [[4G LTE]].

- ### Overview
  - 5G is the successor to [[4G LTE]], standardised by [[3GPP]] with Release 15 frozen in 2018. Unlike prior generations, the architecture was co-designed with virtualisation in mind from the outset:
    - The radio access network uses [[5G New Radio]], a new air interface operating across sub-6 GHz (FR1) and [[Millimetre Wave]] (FR2) spectrum bands.
    - The [[5G Core]] is a fully disaggregated, microservices-based system where each network function (AMF, SMF, UPF, PCF, NRF, AUSF, UDM) is a container-deployable software unit.
    - [[Software-Defined Networking]] principles govern traffic forwarding, enabling dynamic policy enforcement and user-plane function placement at the network edge.
    - [[Multi-Access Edge Computing]] (MEC) nodes co-located at or near base stations reduce application round-trip latency to single-digit milliseconds.
  - Why it matters:
    - Enables [[Extended Reality]] (XR), cloud gaming, and holographic communications at scale.
    - Provides the connectivity substrate for [[Autonomous Vehicles]], smart infrastructure, and [[Digital Twin]] deployments requiring real-time sensing and control.
    - Private 5G deployments on licensed, shared, or unlicensed spectrum are replacing Wi-Fi in demanding industrial environments.
    - The [[O-RAN Alliance]] disaggregation initiative is restructuring the vendor ecosystem, enabling software-defined programmable RAN controllers (RIC) to optimise radio resources using machine-learning models.

- ### Key Components
  - #### Radio Access Network (RAN)
    - **gNB base stations** implement the [[5G New Radio]] interface; they subdivide into CU (centralised unit), DU (distributed unit), and RU (radio unit) in O-RAN architectures.
    - **[[Massive MIMO]]** — arrays of 32–256+ antenna elements enable spatial multiplexing and beamforming, dramatically increasing spectral efficiency versus 4G.
    - **[[Millimetre Wave]]** bands (24–100 GHz) deliver multi-gigabit peak throughputs over short distances; sub-6 GHz bands provide wide-area coverage.
    - **Small cells** — pico- and femtocells densify urban coverage and offload capacity from macro sites.
    - **[[Open RAN]]** — the O-RAN Alliance defines open interfaces (fronthaul eCPRI, E2, O1, A1) enabling multi-vendor RAN decomposition and AI-driven RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs).
  - #### 5G Core (5GC)
    - **AMF** (Access and Mobility Management Function) — handles registration, authentication, and mobility.
    - **SMF** (Session Management Function) — controls session establishment, UPF selection, and policy enforcement.
    - **UPF** (User Plane Function) — the data-plane forwarder; can be instantiated at the edge for local breakout, reducing latency.
    - **PCF** (Policy Control Function) — enforces QoS and charging policies.
    - **NRF** (Network Repository Function) — service discovery registry for all core NFs.
    - **AUSF/UDM** — authentication and subscriber data management.
    - Functions communicate via a Service-Based Interface (SBI) over HTTP/2 + REST, containerised with [[Cloud-Native Architecture]] on Kubernetes.
  - #### [[Network Slicing]]
    - Logically isolated end-to-end slices span RAN, transport, and core, each with independent QoS, security, and resource guarantees.
    - Slice types: eMBB (broadband), URLLC (< 1 ms, 99.9999% reliability), mMTC (low-power, high-density devices).
    - Network Slice Selection Assistance Information (NSSAI) signals which slice a device should use.
  - #### [[Multi-Access Edge Computing]]
    - Compute resources physically distributed at the RAN edge (base station sites, aggregation nodes).
    - Enables ultra-low-latency applications: real-time video analytics, AR overlays, v2x coordination.
    - Standardised through ETSI MEC ISG; integrated with 5GC via LADN and Local Area Data Network configurations.
  - #### Transport Network
    - Fronthaul (RU↔DU), midhaul (DU↔CU), and backhaul (CU↔5GC) segments.
    - Uses fibre (preferred), microwave, and mmWave fixed-wireless links.
    - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) and IEEE 1588 precision timing synchronise the distributed RAN.

- ### Applications and Use Cases
  - **Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB)**
    - Consumer streaming, fixed wireless access (FWA) replacing home broadband in areas with limited fibre.
    - Ultra-HD video, immersive [[Extended Reality]] (AR/VR/MR) over mobile devices.
  - **Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC)**
    - Industrial automation: robotic arms, CNC machine control, collaborative mobile robots on factory floors.
    - [[Autonomous Vehicles]] and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) coordination over PC5 and Uu interfaces.
    - Remote surgery and tele-operation of heavy machinery.
    - Power grid protection with sub-millisecond fault detection and isolation.
  - **Massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC)**
    - [[IoT Infrastructure]] at scale: smart meters, environmental sensors, agricultural IoT.
    - Building management systems (BMS), smart city infrastructure.
    - Asset tracking across logistics and supply-chain networks.
  - **Private 5G Networks**
    - Campus networks for manufacturing (e.g. automotive production lines), ports, airports, mining sites.
    - Dedicated spectrum slices provide guaranteed QoS, physical security isolation, and on-premise data residency.
    - Replaces Wi-Fi and legacy wired fieldbus systems in high-mobility, high-reliability environments.
  - **Network-as-a-Service and B2B slicing**
    - Operators offer slice-as-a-service APIs to enterprises via network exposure functions (NEF).
    - Enables SLA-bound connectivity products programmable by enterprise customers.
