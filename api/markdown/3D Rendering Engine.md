A 3D rendering engine is software that converts three-dimensional geometric data into two-dimensional images through processes including geometry processing, lighting calculation, texture mapping, and rasterisation or ray tracing. In real-time contexts it targets interactive frame rates (90 Hz+) and must minimise motion-to-photon latency for XR presence.

  ## Features
  - **Real-time Rendering**: Processes geometry, lighting, and textures at frame rates suitable for interactive VR/AR (90Hz+)
  - **Stereoscopic Output**: Generates separate views for left and right eyes to create depth perception
  - **Foveated Rendering**: Optimises performance by rendering highest detail only where the user is looking
  - **Physics Integration**: Couples with physics engines for realistic object behaviour and collision detection
  - **Shader Systems**: Programmable graphics pipelines for materials, effects, and post-processing
  - **Level of Detail (LOD)**: Dynamically adjusts geometric complexity based on viewing distance
  - **Motion-to-Photon Latency**: Minimises delay between user movement and visual update (target <20ms)

  ## Use Cases
  - **Metaverse Environments**: Rendering persistent virtual worlds for social interaction and commerce
  - **VR Gaming**: Powering immersive game experiences with high visual fidelity
  - **Industrial Digital Twins**: Visualising manufacturing processes and equipment in real-time
  - **Architectural Visualisation**: Creating walkthrough experiences of building designs
  - **Training Simulations**: Rendering realistic scenarios for education and skills development
  - **AR Overlays**: Compositing 3D content onto real-world camera feeds

- ### Current Landscape (2026)
  - Unreal Engine 5.6 (shipped 2026) is Epic's most performance-focused release of the 5.x line, adding adaptive cluster culling to Nanite, a temporal-change-driven Lumen radiance-cache rework, and far-field spherical-harmonic GI fallback to make locked 60 FPS Nanite+Lumen open worlds achievable on PS5, Xbox Series X and mid-range PCs; 5.7 is now in circulation.
  - 3D Gaussian Splatting has moved from a SIGGRAPH 2023 research paper to a shipped real-time rendering primitive, integrated into UE5 via third-party plugins such as Luma AI's free official plugin, NanoGS (Tim Chen, MIT-licensed, v1.0.1 released 20 March 2026 for UE5.6/5.7) which applies Nanite-style LOD clustering, splat compaction and GPU radix sort, and MLSLabsRenderer-Lite for dynamic 4D volumetric-video playback.
  - Neural and hardware-accelerated lighting is going mainstream: Epic's MegaLights ("Nanite of lights") introduced in UE5.5 continues R&D, while at GDC 2026 NVIDIA released an MIT-licensed real-time Vulkan path-tracing fork of the open-source Godot engine, with the denoiser currently dependent on DLSS Ray Reconstruction and a plan to merge upstream.
  - WebGPU has become the new browser rendering baseline: Unity exposed public experimental WebGPU access in Unity 6.1 (6000.1, 2025) unlocking compute shaders on the web, and community efforts such as the Godot WebGPU backend (public beta 10 May 2026, working across Chrome, Firefox and Safari) report large GPU frame-time speed-ups over WebGL2.
  - On the interchange-standards front, the Alliance for OpenUSD (AOUSD, under the Linux Foundation) ratified OpenUSD Core Specification 1.0 on 17 December 2025 — positioning USD as the "HTML of 3D" with a path towards ISO submission — while OpenUSD v25.08 brought UsdImaging 2.0 to feature parity; Core Spec 1.1 (animation, massive-scene scaling, compliance testing) is targeted for 2026.
  - Key players remain Epic (Unreal/Nanite/Lumen), Unity (URP/HDRP Deferred+, variable-rate shading), the open-source Godot engine (Forward+/Mobile/Compatibility renderers, Vulkan ray-tracing plumbing in 4.7 dev), and NVIDIA (Omniverse, DLSS, path tracing), with capture-side entrants Luma AI and Polycam feeding splat pipelines.
  - Open challenges as of 2026 include the lack of a first-party Gaussian-Splatting module in Unreal (no native GS in 5.7, all paths remain third-party), dynamic lighting and animation for static splat assets, cross-vendor denoisers for path tracing beyond NVIDIA-only DLSS RR, and VRAM/memory pressure when rendering multi-million-Gaussian, city-scale scenes.
