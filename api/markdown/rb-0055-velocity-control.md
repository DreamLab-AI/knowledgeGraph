- ### Definition
  - ### Primary Definition
  **Velocity Control** is a closed-loop control mode in which a robot controller commands and regulates joint or end-effector velocities rather than positions or forces. A PID-based feedback loop reads velocity from encoders and adjusts actuator drive signals to track a commanded speed profile. Velocity control underpins smooth trajectory following and is essential for speed-and-separation monitoring safety functions that require real-time speed capping proportional to human proximity.

- ### Semantic Classification
  - owl-class:: robotics:rb0055velocitycontrol
  - owl-role:: Concept
  - belongs-to-domain:: [[RoboticsDomain]]

- ### Relationships
  - Requires encoder feedback and a feedback control architecture (typically PID).
  - Related to position control (which corrects positional error) and torque control (which acts at the force level).
  - Enables protective stops by providing the speed reference that safety monitors compare against safe-speed thresholds.
  - Feeds into trajectory planning and motion planning pipelines.
