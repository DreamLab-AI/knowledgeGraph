  ## Definition

  **3D Gaussian Splatting** is a breakthrough neural rendering method published at SIGGRAPH 2023 by Kerbl et al., representing 3D scenes as explicit collections of anisotropic 3D Gaussian distributions rather than implicit neural networks. Each Gaussian primitive encodes a 3D position (mean), colour, opacity, and 3×3 covariance matrix defining its shape and orientation in space. Rendering involves "splatting" these Gaussians onto the image plane through differentiable rasterisation, achieving photorealistic quality at 100-300 frames per second on consumer GPUs—over 100× faster than Neural Radiance Fields ([[TELE-052-neural-radiance-fields]]) whilst matching or exceeding visual fidelity.

  The technique trains by optimising Gaussian parameters (positions, colours, covariances) to match input multi-view photographs through gradient descent, starting with sparse 3D point clouds from Structure-from-Motion (SfM). Gaussians are adaptively split, cloned, or pruned during optimisation to capture fine detail (hair strands, foliage) or remove redundancy. The explicit scene representation enables real-time rendering through GPU rasterisation pipelines, unlocking applications in [[TELE-020-virtual-reality-telepresence]], [[TELE-053-volumetric-video-conferencing]], and immersive telepresence where photorealistic environments must render at 90+ FPS for comfortable VR.

  #### Current Landscape
  3D Gaussian Splatting has rapidly transitioned from academic novelty to production deployment, with major telepresence platforms integrating the technology for photorealistic avatars and environments.

  **Adoption Statistics**:
  - 67% of neural rendering research papers (2024-2025) employ Gaussian splatting variants (arXiv analysis)
  - Meta, Apple, Niantic incorporate Gaussian splatting in AR/VR pipelines
  - 14,000+ GitHub stars on official implementation (most-starred graphics paper 2023)
  - Consumer apps (Luma AI, PolyCam) enable smartphone Gaussian capture

  **Technology Capabilities (2025)**:
  - **Training Time**: 30 minutes for room-scale scene on RTX 4090 (vs. 24 hours for NeRF)
  - **Rendering Speed**: 150-300 FPS at 1080p resolution
  - **Quality**: PSNR 30-35 dB (comparable to NeRF, exceeding mesh-based methods)
  - **Scene Size**: Millions of Gaussians represent entire buildings

  **UK Context**:
  - **Luma AI** (London office): Develops NeRF-to-Gaussian conversion tools
  - **PolyCam** (UK users): Gaussian splatting mode in 3D scanning app
  - **University of Oxford**: Research on dynamic Gaussian splatting for moving objects
  - **Imperial College London**: Compression techniques for streaming Gaussian scenes

  ## Technical Details

  ### Scene Representation

  Each 3D Gaussian primitive 𝒢ᵢ defined by:
  - **Mean μᵢ ∈ ℝ³**: 3D position in world space
  - **Covariance Σᵢ ∈ ℝ³ˣ³**: Defines ellipsoidal shape/orientation
  - **Colour cᵢ ∈ ℝ³** (or spherical harmonics for view-dependent appearance)
  - **Opacity αᵢ ∈ [0,1]**: Transparency

  Gaussian function: G(x) = exp(-½(x-μ)ᵀΣ⁻¹(x-μ))

  ### Rendering Pipeline

  1. **Projection**: Transform 3D Gaussians to 2D image space
   - Project mean μᵢ via camera matrix
   - Approximate 2D covariance via Jacobian of projection

  2. **Sorting**: Order Gaussians by depth (painter's algorithm with α-blending)

  3. **Rasterisation**: For each pixel, accumulate colours of overlapping Gaussians
   - Front-to-back traversal with early stopping when opacity saturates
   - GPU-accelerated parallel processing

  4. **Output**: Photorealistic rendered image from novel viewpoint

  ### Optimisation

  **Input**: 50-200 multi-view photographs with camera poses (from SfM)

  **Initialisation**: Sparse 3D point cloud → one Gaussian per point

  **Loss Function**: L1 + SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) between rendered and ground truth images

  **Optimisation**:
  - Stochastic gradient descent with Adam optimiser
  - 30,000 iterations (~30 minutes on RTX 4090)
  - Adaptive density control: split under-reconstructed regions, prune low-opacity Gaussians

  **Result**: Millions of optimised Gaussians encoding scene
