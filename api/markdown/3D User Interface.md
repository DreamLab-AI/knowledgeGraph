A 3D User Interface (3DUI) is an interactive control system within three-dimensional virtual environments enabling users to manipulate objects, navigate spaces, and access functionality through spatial gestures, hand tracking, gaze-based selection, and voice commands. 3DUI design balances accessibility standards with intuitive spatial affordances appropriate for VR, AR, and metaverse interactions.

  ## Overview

  3D User Interfaces represent a fundamental shift from desktop UI paradigms, leveraging volumetric space, embodied interaction, and natural affordances. Design emphasises ergonomics, comfort (avoiding motion sickness and arm fatigue), and cognitive load management.

  ## Interaction Modalities
  - **Hand Tracking**: Gesture-based selection and manipulation, enabling natural interaction
  - **Gaze-Based Selection**: Focusing interaction through eye direction, crucial for accessibility
  - **Voice Commands**: Natural language instruction enabling hands-free control
  - **Haptic Feedback**: Tactile confirmation enhancing perceived interaction fidelity
  - **Controllers**: Traditional handheld input for precise control and navigation

  ## Design Considerations
  - Comfort and ergonomic positioning within reach and visibility cones
  - Intuitive spatial metaphors avoiding cognitive friction
  - Accessibility for users with motor and sensory impairments
  - Motion sickness mitigation through stable visual anchors

- ### Current Landscape (2026)
  - Apple's visionOS 26 (previewed WWDC June 2025, GA 15 September 2025) reframed 3D UI around persistent spatial widgets that anchor in a room and survive restarts, 3D-aware SwiftUI modifiers with depth-based layout, generative-AI "spatial scenes" from 2D photos, and Safari inline 3D models — with the "Liquid Glass" design language now propagated across all Apple OSes as a spatialised aesthetic.
  - visionOS 27 (WWDC 2026) pushed 3D interaction further with real-time RealityKit rendering of 3D Gaussian Splats, physical-space lighting that casts virtual light onto real surfaces, a Foveated Streaming framework (introduced in 26.4) that integrates with the NVIDIA CloudXR SDK for OpenXR endpoints, and spatial-accessory input such as the Logitech Muse stylus and PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers.
  - Android XR (announced 12 December 2024 by Google, Samsung and Qualcomm) shipped in a consumer device: the Samsung Galaxy XR (formerly Project Moohan) launched 21 October 2025 at 1,799 US dollars, running Gemini as a system-level assistant and adopting OpenXR and ARCore, so ordinary 2D Google Play apps spatialise into resizable floating panels.
  - A pricing and competitive split hardened through 2026: the Galaxy XR at 1,799 dollars undercuts the M5 Apple Vision Pro, which rose to 3,699 dollars for 256 GB after a 25 June 2026 increase; Meta opened Horizon OS to ASUS, Lenovo and Xbox while XREAL's Aura took reservations at a sub-1,500-dollar ceiling.
  - Platform 3D-UI design guidance has converged on concrete, quantified ergonomics: Meta's May 2026 Hands UI guidance sets a 48dp/~22mm minimum hit target, ~2.5–3 degree minimum angular collider and 42–46cm touch distance, while Android XR's spatial-UI guidance fixes panel spawn at 1.75m, a 41-degree comfort field of view and spatial elevation levels for orbiters, popups and dialogs.
  - Interaction has settled on a tiered input model — direct touch/poke within arm's reach, stabilised ray casting for distant panels, plus eye tracking, microgestures and voice — with eye-tracked foveated rendering now a mainstream performance lever and a locked high frame rate (72fps+, sub-20ms motion-to-photon) treated as the primary comfort constraint.
  - Standards remain anchored on the W3C WebXR Device API and Khronos OpenXR/glTF, but open challenges as of 2026 persist: hand-tracking precision and arm fatigue for sustained fine manipulation, battery life under two hours, absent enterprise MDM on new platforms, and privacy governance around always-on eye/gaze and passthrough-fed AI assistants.
