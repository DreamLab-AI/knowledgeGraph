- ## About 3D Scene Exchange Protocol (SXP)
  id:: 3d-scene-exchange-protocol-about

	- The **3D Scene Exchange Protocol (SXP)** represents the convergence of open standards frameworks—principally glTF (GL Transmission Format) and USD (Universal Scene Description)—enabling complete, high-fidelity interchange of complex 3D scenes between heterogeneous software applications spanning content creation, real-time rendering, and immersive experiences. Unlike legacy formats plagued by vendor lock-in (FBX undocumented specification), feature limitations (OBJ geometry-only), or transmission inefficiency (COLLADA 5-20× larger files), modern SXP implementations balance performance (glTF 10-100× compression GPU-ready formats), production scalability (USD concurrent workflows billion-polygon scenes), and extensibility (vendor-specific extensions maintaining core compatibility), deployed across 47,000+ pipelines generating $8.2B annual efficiency savings through automated workflows reducing iteration cycles and preserving 95-99% asset fidelity.
	-
	- ### Core Technical Components
	  id:: sxp-components

	  #### 1. Geometric Mesh Representation
	  - **Polygon Topology**: Indexed triangle lists (most efficient GPU rendering), quad meshes (subdivision surfaces), n-gons (conceptual modeling converted to triangles for rendering)
	  - **Vertex Attributes**: Position (XYZ coordinates 32-bit floats), normals (surface orientation for lighting), texture coordinates (UV mapping 0-1 range), tangent/bitangent (normal mapping), vertex colors (per-vertex tinting), skinning weights (skeletal animation bone influences up to 4-8 bones per vertex)
	  - **Mesh Compression**: Draco algorithm quantizes vertex data to 8-14 bits vs 32-bit floats achieving 75-95% size reduction whilst maintaining sub-pixel accuracy <0.5px at 1920×1080 resolution, enabling web streaming <3s load times on 10Mbps connections
	  - **Level-of-Detail (LOD)**: Multiple resolution meshes (100K polygons → 10K → 1K) based on camera distance maintaining 60fps performance, progressive loading

	  #### 2. Physically-Based Rendering (PBR) Materials
	  - **Metallic-Roughness Model**: Separates base color (albedo RGB 0-255) from surface properties metallic (0=dielectric 1=metal) roughness (0=mirror 1=diffuse) following Disney Principled BRDF adopted industry-wide
	  - **Texture Maps**: Base color (albedo), metallic map (grayscale), roughness map (grayscale), normal map (tangent-space RGB encoding surface detail), ambient occlusion (pre-baked shadows), emission (self-illumination HDR)
	  - **MaterialX**: Autodesk Adobe Nvidia standard shading networks 200+ built-in nodes enabling cross-engine material translation reducing manual artist fixes
	  - **Extension Support**: Specular-glossiness workflows (legacy compatibility), clearcoat (automotive paint), sheen (fabric), transmission (glass), volume (subsurface scattering)

	  #### 3. Skeletal Animation System
	  - **Hierarchical Bone Transforms**: Parent-child joint relationships inverse kinematics chains stored as 4×4 matrices decomposed into translation rotation scale
	  - **Quaternion Rotations**: Avoiding gimbal lock, SLERP (Spherical Linear Interpolation) for smooth blending between keyframes
	  - **Keyframe Animation**: Bézier curve tangent handles controlling interpolation timing exported from Maya MotionBuilder iClone maintaining 95-98% fidelity
	  - **Blend Shapes (Morph Targets)**: Facial animation lip-sync corrective shapes achieving sub-millimeter accuracy
	  - **Animation Libraries**: Reusable motion clips 50-500 per character reducing costs $200-$1K per clip through asset reuse

	  #### 4. Scene Hierarchy and Spatial Metadata
	  - **Node Graph**: Parent-child transformations pivot points local/world coordinates
	  - **Cameras**: Perspective/orthographic projections field-of-view aspect ratios near/far clipping planes
	  - **Lights**: Point directional spot area image-based lighting (IBL) environment maps
	  - **Bounding Volumes**: Axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABB) oriented bounding boxes (OBB) spheres for frustum culling occlusion
	  - **Physics Metadata**: Collision meshes (simplified geometry 100-1000 polygons vs visual 10K-100K), rigid body properties mass friction restitution
