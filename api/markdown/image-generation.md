  - ### [GALA3D: Towards Text-to-3D Complex Scene Generation via Layout-guided Generative Gaussian Splatting](https://huggingface.co/papers/2402.07207) - //huggingface.co/papers/2402.07207) in UK English spelling, presented as bullet points:

  - The paper introduces a new method for improving the colourisation of greyscale images using diffusion models.
  - It addresses the problem of colour ambiguity in greyscale images by incorporating semantic information and user guidance.
  - The approach uses a diffusion model conditioned on both the greyscale image and semantic segmentation maps, allowing for more accurate and consistent colour assignments.
  - A user interface is provided, enabling users to interactively influence the colourisation process through colour hints or strokes.
  - The model can be used to organise and visualise large collections of greyscale images, by applying consistent colourisation styles across the dataset.
  - The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing greyscale image colourisation techniques.
  - The user controlled component allows for finer control over colour choices compared to automatic systems.
  - The colourisation process is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different types of images and user preferences.

  - ### **Point·E System**
		- [Point·E GitHub](https://github.com/openai/point-e) - - Point-E is a system developed by OpenAI for efficiently creating 3D point clouds from text prompts.
  - It offers a fast and direct method for 3D object generation, bypassing the slower and more complex process of first creating a mesh and then rendering.
  - The system utilises a series of models: a text-to-image model followed by an image-to-3D point cloud model.
  - It provides code for training and sampling these models, allowing users to experiment with custom datasets and text prompts.
  - The code includes utilities for visualising and manipulating the generated point clouds, including features for altering their colour and density.
  - A significant advantage of Point-E is its speed; it can produce 3D models significantly faster than previous approaches.

  - ### Novel VP Render Pipeline:
		- Putting the ML image generation on the end of a real-time tracked camera render pipeline might remove the need for detail in set building. The set designer, DP, director, etc., will be able to ideate in a headset-based metaverse of the set design, dropping very basic elements. If the interframe consistency (img2img) can deliver, the output on the VP screen can simply inherit the artistic style from the text prompts and render production quality from the basic building blocks. This "next level pre-vis" is being trailed in the Vircadia collaborative environment described in this book.

		- Putting the ML image generation on the end of a real-time tracked camera render pipeline might remove the need for detail in set building. The set designer, DP, director, etc., will be able to ideate in a headset-based metaverse of the set design, dropping very basic elements. If the interframe consistency (img2img) can deliver, the output on the VP screen can simply inherit the artistic style from the text prompts and render production quality from the basic building blocks. This "next level pre-vis" is being trailed in the Vircadia collaborative environment described in this book.

  - ## Image, Video and 3D
		- [[Stable Diffusion Image Model]] and [[Stable Video Diffusion]] allow a lot of control, but at a cost of complexity.

			- ### Text-to-Image Generation
				- Stable Diffusion generates realistic and imaginative images from descriptive text prompts. This core functionality allows users to translate their creative visions into visual form with remarkable accuracy and detail. Whether it's a photorealistic portrait, a surreal landscape, or an abstract concept, Stable Diffusion can bring your ideas to life with just a few words.
				- A lot of the products you see on the market are either wrappers for the big AI companies, or else leveraging Stability models on rented cloud compute.

  - # Vision Mamba
		- Majority of Mamba papers (over 60%) address vision/image processing, especially biomedical image segmentation
		- Key themes:
			- Representing data as sequences is crucial
			- Images are not inherently sequential like language, music, or DNA
			- Multi-scan approaches enable handling non-sequential data
			- Hybrid architectures leverage strengths of different models
		- Open questions and challenges:
			- Scaling to larger models and datasets
			- Developing state regularization methods
			- Integrating Mamba with other architectural advances (e.g., memory tokens)
		- Potential for transformative impact, especially in biology and vision applications
		- Approaches:
			- U-Mamba (U-Mamba): Hybrid CNN-SSM architecture outperforming CNN and Transformers in biomedical image segmentation
			- Swin-UMamba (Swin-UMamba): Combines Mamba with ImageNet pre-training, outperforms U-Mamba
			- Vision Mamba: Bidirectional (forward and backward) scanning for learning visual representations
			- VMamba: Four-way "cross-scan" starting at each corner, combining representations
			- VM-UNet (VM-UNet): Applies VMamba's four-way scan to medical image segmentation
			- Mamba-ND: Multi-dimensional sequencing for video and weather data, using sequential SSMs
			- SegMamba: 3D image segmentation with three-way scan, handling long sequences

  - # IP-Adapter: Text Compatible Image Prompt Adapter for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models
  - Hu Ye Jun Zhang Sibo Liu Xiao Han Wei Yang Tencent AI Lab4-5 minutes

	  ---

  Recent years have witnessed the strong power of large text-to-image diffusion models for the impressive generative capability to create high-fidelity images. But, it is very tricky to generate desired images using only text prompt as it often involves complex prompt engineering. An alternative to text prompt is image prompt, as the saying goes: "an image is worth a thousand words". Although existing methods of direct fine-tuning from pretrained models are effective, they require large computing resources and are not compatible with other base models, text prompt, and structural controls. In this paper, we present IP-Adapter, an effective and lightweight adapter to achieve image prompt capability for the pretrained text-to-image diffusion models. The key design of our IP-Adapter is decoupled cross-attention mechanism that separates cross-attention layers for text features and image features. Despite the simplicity of our method, an IP-Adapter with only 22M parameters can achieve comparable or even better performance to a fine-tuned image prompt model. As we freeze the pretrained duffusion model, the proposed IP-Adapter can be generalized not only to other custom models fine-tuned from the same base model, but also to controllable generation using existing controllable tools. With the benefit of the decoupled cross-attention strategy, the image prompt can also work well with the text prompt to accomplish multimodal image generation.

  - ## Abstract

  Recent years have witnessed the strong power of large text-to-image diffusion models for the impressive generative capability to create high-fidelity images. But, it is very tricky to generate desired images using only text prompt as it often involves complex prompt engineering. An alternative to text prompt is image prompt, as the saying goes: "an image is worth a thousand words". Although existing methods of direct fine-tuning from pretrained models are effective, they require large computing resources and are not compatible with other base models, text prompt, and structural controls. In this paper, we present IP-Adapter, an effective and lightweight adapter to achieve image prompt capability for the pretrained text-to-image diffusion models. The key design of our IP-Adapter is decoupled cross-attention mechanism that separates cross-attention layers for text features and image features. Despite the simplicity of our method, an IP-Adapter with only 22M parameters can achieve comparable or even better performance to a fine-tuned image prompt model. As we freeze the pretrained duffusion model, the proposed IP-Adapter can be generalized not only to other custom models fine-tuned from the same base model, but also to controllable generation using existing controllable tools. With the benefit of the decoupled cross-attention strategy, the image prompt can also work well with the text prompt to accomplish multimodal image generation.
