Dynamically adjusts based on block gas usage, increasing if blocks exceed target size and decreasing if below target. Base fee is burned, not transferred to validators.\n\t\n\t### Implementation Across Blockchains\n\tBase fee is the algorithmically determined minimum gas price required for transaction inclusion in Ethereum blocks following the EIP-1559 upgrade (London hard fork, August 2021), dynamically adjusting based on network congestion with up to 12.5% changes per block rather than auction-based pricing. Implemented in Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain (post-upgrade), Avalanche C-Chain, and other EIP-1559-compatible chains, base fee increases when blocks exceed 50% capacity and decreases when below, with all base fees burned (permanently removed from circulation) rather than paid to validators. This mechanism has burned over 3 million ETH since implementation, creates deflationary pressure on token supply, provides predictable transaction pricing through algorithmic adjustment, and separates minimum cost from validator incentivization (priority fees).\n\t\n  \n  Creates deflationary pressure by permanently removing ETH from circulation.\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
