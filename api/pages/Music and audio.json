The tweet sparked interest, leading to someone building the platform called Beatly Music, while some artists expressed interest in the idea. However, industry insiders, including Scott Belsky, have questioned why Spotify might not just do this themselves since they already have the fan graph, the data set, and relationship with artists. But it may be too risky to navigate for a large company with record labels as a key stakeholder. While the idea has potential, there are many ethical and legal issues with this model, especially with labels. Nevertheless, Beatly Music carries a considerable risk as several legal concerns may arise regarding music rights and royalties, stating that some significant damages, including - Side note, [Japan Goes All In: Copyright Doesn’t Apply To AI Training | BIIA.com | Business Information Industry Association](https://www.biia.co... - [[copyright]] infringement charges or compounding royalties to record labels and artists, might come up. https://twitter.com/rrhoover/status/1647735300511154176\n\t- WavTool is an AI-powered music production tool that is free to use online.
