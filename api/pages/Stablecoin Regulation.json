(2019). *In search for stability in crypto-assets: are stablecoins the solution?* ECB Occasional Paper Series, No. 230. https://doi.org/10.2866/126235\n  - Moin, A., & Yermack, D. (2023). *Stablecoins and the Future of Payments.* Journal of Financial Regulation, 9(1), 45-67. https://doi.org/10.1093/jfr/fraa034\n  - Zetzsche, D. A., Buckley, R. P., Arner, D. W., & Barberis, J.
