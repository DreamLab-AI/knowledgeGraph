However, unlike eCash, every transaction made through Ark is backed by actual bitcoins, preventing the possibility of the Ark Service Provider (ASP) stealing or inflating them. Compared to Lightning, another payment network, Ark does not introduce liquidity constraints or a direct link between the sender and receiver, enabling recipients to receive payments without acquiring inbound liquidity or revealing their identity. In terms of UX, Ark mimics on-chain wallets by allowing async receiving and not introducing inbound liquidity constraints, but requires users to come online and \"refresh\" their coins every few weeks, or else the ASP can sweep the funds. Compared to validity rollups, Ark's higher throughput is due to not requiring on-chain data per transaction. If an ASP were to double-spend their pool transactions on mempool, incoming zero-conf vtxos can be used to pay lightning invoices, rendering double-spending a footgun for the service operator. A future extension of Ark can utilize a hypothetical data manipulation opcode to prevent double-spending. https://www.arkpill.me/faq\n\n\t- ## Market Opportunity\n\t\t- Consumer AI spending is estimated at $12 billion.\n\t\t- Only 3% of users pay for AI solutions, representing a significant untapped revenue opportunity.\n\n\t- ## AI Purchasing Trends\n\t\t- Spending on AI applications increased from $600 million in 2023 to $4.6 billion in 2024.\n\t\t- Enterprises are identifying an average of 10 AI use cases, with nearly 25% prioritised for near-term implementation.\n\t\t- Application-level spending signals a maturing AI journey with organisations focusing on transformative workflows.\n\n- # Ramp Spring 2025 Business Spending Report\n\t- [Ramp’s Spring 2025 Business Spending Report](https://ramp.com/blog/q1-2025-spending-insights)\n\t- **Increase in AI Adoption:**\n\t\t- 35.5% of U.S. businesses now utilize AI, a figure 4.4 times higher than previously reported by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\t\t- The technology, finance, and manufacturing sectors are leading in AI implementation.\n\t- **AI Vendor Adoption:**\n\t\t- OpenAI is the definitive leader in business adoption, with Anthropic following.\n\t\t- Google's AI models have seen a rapid rise in usage, with 69% of respondents to a Kong Inc. survey reporting use of Google's models in the last 90 days, compared to 55% for OpenAI.\n\t- **AI as a Key Productivity Tool:**\n\t\t- 61% of business leaders confirmed their organizations accelerated AI usage in 2024, with more than half planning to increase their AI budgets in 2025.\n\t\t- 72% of enterprises plan to increase their spending on generative AI in the next year, with nearly 40% of those indicating an investment exceeding $250,000 in the current calendar year.\n\n\t- #### Spending it\n\t\t- Since this book seeks to examine transfer of value within a purely digital environment it is necessary to ask the question of whether Bitcoin is money. This short [‘story’](https://bitcoin-zar.blogspot.com/2018/07/duality-excerpt-by-satoshi-nakomoto.html),purportedly written by Nakamoto, is a fabulous look at the money values of the technology, irrespective if it’s provenance. In it is the following text:\n\t\t\t- “Here, for once, was this idea that you could generate your own form of money. That’s the primary and sole reason, is because it was related to this thing called money. It wasn’t about the proficiency of the code or the novelty, it was because it had to do with money. It centred around money. That is something people cared about. After all, plenty of projects on Sourceforge at the time were just as well coded, well maintained, if not better, by teams, and even if someone else had created the blockchain before me, had it been used for something else beyond currency, it probably would not have had much of an outcome.\n\t\t- Again, irrespective of the author here, this point seems to ring true.The memetic power of Bitcoin is in it’s proximity to ‘money’, and the potential of the separation of money from the state.\n\t\t- It is beyond argument that the Bitcoin network is a rugged message passing protocol which achieves a high degree of consensus about the entries on it’s distributed database.\n\t\t- Ascribing monetary value to those database entries is a social consensus problem, and this itself is a contested topic. The most useful ‘hot take’ here is that Bitcoin behaves most like [a‘property’](https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1395788419301773312),while it’s network behaves far more like a monetary network which is created and supported by the [value of the Bitcointokens](https://saito.tech/an-response-to-paul-krugman-from-a-keynesian-bitcoiner/).\n\t\t- Jack Mallers, of Strike [presentation to theIMF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb-45m9f76I) identified thefollowing challenges which he claims are solved by the bitcoin monetarynetwork.\n\t\t\t- Speed\n\t\t\t- Limited transparency and dependability\n\t\t\t- High cost\n\t\t\t- Lack of interoperability\n\t\t\t- Limited Coverage\n\t\t\t- Limited accessibility\n\t\t- He further identifies the attributes of the ideal global money.\n\t\t\t- Uncensorable\n\t\t\t- Unfreezable\n\t\t\t- Permissionless\n\t\t\t- Borderless\n\t\t\t- Liquid\n\t\t\t- Digital\n\t\t- Mallers has recently announced USA focused partnerships which leverage his Strike product to enable spending Bitcoin, through Lightning, as Dollars in much of the [point ofsale](https://www.ncr.com/point-of-sale-pos-systems) infrastructure in the USA. This is a huge advance as it immediately enables the vendors both online and at physical locations to either save 3% costs for card processors, or else pass this on as a discount. Crucially for ‘Bitcoin as a money’ it also allows the vendors to receive the payment **as**Bitcoin, not Dollars. A possible further and highly significant feature is that it might now be possible to divest of Bitcoin in the USA, buying goods, without a capital gains tax implication. Mallers claims to have legislative backing for this product, but the devil will likely be in the detail. The likely mechanism for this product is that the EPOS partner sends a Lighting request to Strike, which liquidates some of their Bitcoin holding to a dollar denominated stable coin, but in a tax free jurisdiction such as El Salvador. This stablecoin will then be sent to the EPOS handing partner such as NCR. Stablecoin to Dollar transactions in the USA are much murkier and likely don’t cost anything for these companies. This agent will then authorise the Dollar denominated sale to the American digital till. Crucially nobody has a US capital gains tax exposure in this chain, and all of the settlements were near free, and instantaneous, with ‘cash finality’ for everyone except the EPOS company. They are likely actually exposed to a small risk here because uptake will be very low level. The novelty opportunity will likely cover any potential exposure to stablecoin collapse. This isa radical upgrade on the normal flow of divesting Bitcoin for American users.\n\t\t- Using this open product to spend Bitcoin as Bitcoin to vendors might be available through Shopify globally. Again, it’s too new to be sure. Promisingly a [Deloittestudy](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/technology/us-cons-merchant-getting-ready-for-crypto.pdf) has found that 93% of businesses accepting Bitcoin have seen revenue and brand perception improve, and 75% of USA sales execs plan to accept digital assets at some point in the next 2 years. This ambition in the US markets is likely to benefit from the proposed $200 tax exempt law for purchasing goods and services with Bitcoin.\n\t\t- Of these recent developments in Lightning [Lyn Aldensays](https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1512188883101966351):itSome people naturally dismiss \\[strike\\] because they don’t want to spend their BTC; they want to save it. However, the more places that accepted BTC at point of sale (on-chain or Lightning or otherwise), the more permissionless the whole network is. This is because, if all you can do with BTC is convert it back into fiat on a major exchange, then it’s easy to isolate it, effectively blacklist addresses, etc. But if you can directly spend it on goods and services across companies and jurisdictions, it’s harder to isolate. There are now plenty of vendors that make this easy for merchants to implement, and the merchant can still receive dollars if they want (rather than BTC), or can decide their % split. Since it’s an open network, anyone can build on it, globally. And then when you add fiat-to-BTC-to-fiat payments over Lightning, it gets even more interesting because it doesn’t necessarily need to be a taxable event. Lightning wallets with a BTC balance and a USD/stable coin balance. Lower fees than Visa and others.\n\n\t\t\t- #### Receiving Ecash\n\t\t\t\t- Implement the ability to receive ecash by processing transactions from others.
