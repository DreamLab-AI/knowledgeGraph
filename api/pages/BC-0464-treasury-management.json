Unlike traditional corporate treasuries where asset allocation, investment strategies, and capital deployment are determined by executives with quarterly reporting to shareholders and regulatory filings, DAO treasuries operate through on-chain governance where every proposed expenditure—from developer grants to protocol-owned liquidity deployments—requires token holder approval via formal proposals, creating unprecedented transparency whilst introducing novel challenges around decision paralysis, governance attacks targeting treasury assets, and the tension between fiduciary duty to maximize treasury value and protocol mission alignment. The 2020-2025 period witnessed explosive treasury growth, with major DAOs collectively controlling over **$25 billion** in assets by 2024-2025: [[MakerDAO]]/Sky Protocol ($8B+ treasury including DAI reserves and collateral), [[Uniswap]] ($5-7B in UNI tokens plus protocol-owned liquidity), [[Aave]] ($3B+ safety module and treasury reserves), [[Compound]] ($3B protocol reserves), and [[Curve]] ($2B+ in CRV and protocol-owned liquidity). This scale simultaneously demonstrated DAOs' capacity to accumulate and preserve community-owned capital whilst exposing persistent challenges: extreme treasury concentration in native governance tokens (creating correlation risk where treasury value crashes when protocol struggles), low capital efficiency (billions sitting idle in wallets earning zero yield), governance overhead for routine spending decisions, multi-signature custody risks, and regulatory uncertainty around DAO treasuries' legal ownership and taxation.\n\n  ### Treasury Architecture and Custody Models\n\n  DAO treasuries employ various smart contract architectures balancing security, governance efficiency, and operational flexibility:\n\n  **Multi-Signature Wallets (Gnosis Safe):**\n\n  The most common treasury custody model uses **multi-signature** (multisig) contracts requiring M-of-N signatures to execute transactions:\n\n  - **Example configuration**: 4-of-7 multisig requires 4 signatures from 7 authorized signers to move funds\n  - **Gnosis Safe** (formerly Gnosis Multisig): Industry-standard implementation managing $100B+ across DeFi, supporting complex transaction batching, module extensions, and spending limits\n  - **Signer selection**: Typically includes core team members, community-elected stewards, legal entity representatives, and sometimes third-party custody services\n  - **Operational security**: Geographically distributed signers, hardware wallet requirements (Ledger, Trezor), timelocks for large transactions, regular signer rotation\n\n  **Example Major DAO Multisigs:**\n  - **Uniswap Foundation**: 6-of-9 multisig controlling grants program funds\n  - **ENS DAO**: 4-of-7 multisig for working group budgets\n  - **Aave Safety Module**: 5-of-10 multisig emergency controls\n  - **Compound Grants Program**: 3-of-5 multisig for grant distributions\n\n  **Fully On-Chain Governance (Timelock Controlled):**\n\n  Some treasuries eliminate multisigs entirely, requiring all spending pass through formal governance:\n\n  - **Governor + Timelock architecture**: Treasury funds held by Timelock contract, only executable after successful [[BC-0462-on-chain-voting|on-chain governance vote]]\n  - **Benefits**: Maximum transparency and decentralization, no trusted multisig signers, all spending requires community approval\n  - **Drawbacks**: Slow (7-day vote + 2-7 day timelock = 9-14 day minimum for any transaction), expensive (gas costs for proposal submission), vulnerable to governance attacks, cannot respond quickly to market opportunities\n\n  **Hybrid Models (Delegated Spending Authority):**\n\n  Most mature DAOs adopt hybrid approaches balancing efficiency and oversight:\n\n  - **Elected working groups**: Community votes annually to allocate budgets to specific working groups (grants, marketing, development, legal), which operate multisigs for day-to-day spending within approved budgets\n  - **Spending thresholds**: Small transactions (<$50K) executable via multisig, large transactions (>$500K) require full governance vote\n  - **Quarterly reporting**: Working groups publish transaction reports, community can revoke authority via governance vote if dissatisfied\n  - **Timelocks for large transactions**: Even multisig-authorized large transactions enter timelock period for community review before execution\n\n  **Examples:**\n  - **Optimism Collective**: Bicameral governance with Token House (protocol upgrades) and Citizens' House (public goods funding via RetroPGF)\n  - **ENS DAO**: Elected stewards manage specific domains (ecosystem, meta-governance, public goods) with term limits and budget constraints\n  - **Uniswap**: Foundation multisig operates within community-approved budget, large allocations require governance vote\n\n  ### Treasury Composition and Asset Allocation\n\n  DAO treasuries evolved from single-asset (100% native governance token) to diversified portfolios reducing volatility and correlation risk:\n\n  **Historical Evolution (2020-2025):**\n\n  **Phase 1 (2020-2021): Native Token Concentration**\n  - Early DAOs held 90-100% of treasury in native governance tokens\n  - Example: Uniswap treasury was 1B UNI (100% correlation with protocol success/failure)\n  - Risk: Treasury value crashed during bear markets (UNI fell from $40 to $3, 92.5% decline)\n\n  **Phase 2 (2021-2023): Stablecoin Diversification**\n  - DAOs began diversifying into stablecoins (USDC, DAI, USDT) to reduce volatility\n  - Typical allocation: 60-70% native token, 30-40% stablecoins\n  - Method: OTC token sales to VCs/institutions (sell native tokens for stablecoins/ETH without market impact)\n\n  **Phase 3 (2023-2025): Multi-Asset Portfolios + RWAs**\n  - Sophisticated treasuries hold native tokens, stablecoins, blue-chip crypto (ETH, BTC), real-world assets (U.S. Treasury bills, bonds), and revenue-generating DeFi positions\n  - Typical allocation: 40-50% native token, 30-35% stablecoins, 10-15% ETH/BTC, 5-10% RWAs, 5-10% DeFi yield strategies\n\n  **Real-World Treasury Compositions (2024-2025):**\n\n  **MakerDAO/Sky Protocol Treasury ($8B+):**\n  - **DAI Reserves**: $5B+ in DAI backed by collateral\n  - **Collateral Assets**: $6-7B in USDC, ETH, wBTC, stETH, RWAs (U.S. Treasury bills via Monetalis)\n  - **Surplus Buffer**: $100M+ DAI as protocol reserves (backstop for undercollateralization)\n  - **MKR Holdings**: Protocol treasury holds minimal MKR (MKR burned from fees rather than accumulated)\n  - **RWA Exposure**: $1-2B in tokenized U.S. Treasury bills (highest RWA adoption amongst major DAOs)\n\n  **Uniswap DAO Treasury ($5-7B):**\n  - **UNI Tokens**: 430M UNI (~$3.2B at $7.50/UNI) in community treasury\n  - **Diversification**: Minimal diversification beyond UNI as of 2024-2025 (controversial decision)\n  - **Protocol-Owned Liquidity**: Some UNI/ETH liquidity pairs owned by protocol\n  - **Grants Program**: $74M allocated to Uniswap Foundation for ecosystem grants (2021-2025)\n\n  **Aave DAO Treasury ($3B+):**\n  - **AAVE Tokens**: Safety Module holds ~2.8M staked AAVE (~$434M)\n  - **Protocol Reserves**: $2-3B in aTokens (interest-bearing assets from protocol fees)\n  - **Diversified Holdings**: USDC, USDT, DAI, wETH, wBTC\n  - **Revenue Generation**: Treasury assets deposited in Aave protocol earning yield (2-8% APY)\n\n  **Compound DAO Treasury ($3B+):**\n  - **Protocol Reserves**: $2-3B in cTokens (Compound's interest-bearing tokens)\n  - **COMP Holdings**: Protocol holds COMP for liquidity incentives\n  - **Conservative Allocation**: Primarily stablecoins and major crypto assets (ETH, BTC)\n  - **Revenue Reinvestment**: Reserves grow from protocol fees automatically deposited\n\n  **Arbitrum DAO Treasury ($3-4B):**\n  - **ARB Tokens**: Billions of ARB allocated for ecosystem development\n  - **Diversification Strategy**: $215M token sale to institutional investors (2023) for operational stablecoin runway\n  - **Grants Program**: $71M+ allocated to ecosystem grants\n  - **Gaming & DeFi Incentives**: Hundreds of millions in ARB for ecosystem growth\n\n  ### Treasury Diversification Strategies\n\n  DAOs employ various methods to diversify beyond native tokens whilst minimizing market impact and maintaining decentralization:\n\n  **OTC Token Sales (Over-The-Counter):**\n\n  Large token sales to institutional investors/VCs at negotiated prices:\n\n  - **Method**: DAO proposes selling X tokens for Y stablecoins/ETH to specified counterparty, community votes approval, transaction executed off-market\n  - **Benefits**: No market slippage (doesn't crash token price), raises stablecoin treasury, creates long-term aligned investors\n  - **Drawbacks**: Sells tokens at discount (typically 10-30% below market price), may violate securities laws, creates centralized ownership\n\n  **Examples:**\n  - **Arbitrum**: Sold $215M ARB to institutional investors (2023)\n  - **Optimism**: Allocated tokens to strategic partners for ecosystem development\n  - **Numerous DAOs**: Conducted OTC sales to a16z, Paradigm, Jump Crypto, Wintermute\n\n  **Token Swaps with Partner Protocols:**\n\n  DAOs exchange native tokens with complementary protocols creating mutual alignment:\n\n  - **Example**: Protocol A swaps 1M TokenA for 1M TokenB with Protocol B, both protocols now incentivized for mutual success\n  - **Benefits**: Diversification without selling to market, creates protocol partnerships, aligns incentives\n  - **Drawbacks**: Still correlated crypto exposure (both tokens may crash together), governance complexity (does Protocol A vote in Protocol B governance?)\n\n  **Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL):**\n\n  DAOs deploy treasury assets as DEX liquidity rather than renting liquidity via farming incentives:\n\n  - **Traditional Model**: Pay token emissions to liquidity providers (mercenary capital, disappears when incentives end)\n  - **POL Model**: DAO treasury provides liquidity using native tokens + stablecoins, earns trading fees, owns liquidity permanently\n  - **Benefits**: Sustainable liquidity (doesn't require ongoing emissions), treasury earns fees, reduces token dilution\n  - **Drawbacks**: Impermanent loss risk, capital tied up in liquidity pools\n\n  **Examples:**\n  - **Olympus DAO**: Pioneered POL via bonding mechanism (90%+ of OHM liquidity was protocol-owned at peak)\n  - **Curve**: Uses CRV emissions to incentivize liquidity whilst building POL position\n  - **Tokemak**: Designed specifically for protocol liquidity management\n\n  **Real-World Asset (RWA) Allocation:**\n\n  DAOs increasingly allocate to tokenized traditional assets (U.S. Treasury bills, bonds, commodities):\n\n  - **Method**: Purchase tokenized RWAs from issuers (Ondo Finance, Backed Finance, MatrixDock) or via DeFi protocols (MakerDAO's Monetalis Vault)\n  - **Benefits**: Yield generation (3-5% on T-bills vs 0% on idle stablecoins), volatility reduction, regulatory comfort (investing in government securities less controversial than crypto speculation)\n  - **Drawbacks**: Regulatory risk (RWA issuers may face securities enforcement), counterparty risk (tokenization protocols may fail), liquidity risk (RWAs harder to sell quickly than crypto)\n\n  **Examples:**\n  - **MakerDAO**: $1-2B in tokenized U.S. Treasury bills (largest DAO RWA allocation)\n  - **Frax Finance**: Allocated treasury to U.S. Treasury bonds via Frax Bond Protocol\n  - **Mountain Protocol**: USDM stablecoin backed by short-term T-bills, held by various DAO treasuries\n\n  ### Treasury Management Operations and Tooling\n\n  DAOs utilize specialized infrastructure for treasury operations:\n\n  **Treasury Management Platforms:**\n\n  - **Parcel**: Treasury management dashboard, payment scheduling, spending analytics, multi-chain support\n  - **Coinshift (formerly Multis)**: Gnosis Safe UI for DAOs, fiat on/off-ramp integration, payroll automation\n  - **Llama**: DAO treasury management service, provides grants program administration, financial reporting, strategy consulting\n  - **Gnosis Safe**: Industry standard multisig, supports modules for automated operations, spending policies\n\n  **Treasury Analytics and Transparency:**\n\n  - **DeepDAO**: Aggregates DAO treasury data, tracks holdings, proposals, member participation across 1000+ DAOs\n  - **Nansen**: On-chain analytics tracking DAO treasury transactions, token flows, whale movements\n  - **Dune Analytics**: Community-built dashboards visualizing treasury composition, spending, revenue\n  - **DeBank**: Portfolio tracker showing real-time treasury holdings across chains\n\n  **Automated Investment Strategies:**\n\n  Smart contract modules executing predefined treasury management strategies:\n\n  - **Yield optimization**: Automatically deposit idle stablecoins in highest-yield protocols (Aave, Compound, Yearn)\n  - **Rebalancing**: Maintain target allocation percentages (e.g., 50% native token, 30% stablecoin, 20% ETH) via automated swaps\n  - **Dollar-cost averaging**: Programmatically sell small amounts of native tokens for stablecoins over time to diversify without market impact\n  - **Revenue collection**: Automatically sweep protocol fees into treasury\n\n  **Examples:**\n  - **Aave Treasury**: Deposits reserves in Aave protocol earning yield\n  - **Yearn Treasury**: Uses Yearn strategies for treasury yield generation\n  - **Enzyme Finance**: DAO asset management protocol enabling complex investment strategies\n\n  ### Treasury Spending and Grant Programs\n\n  DAOs allocate treasuries across ecosystem development, grants, operations, and protocol incentives:\n\n  **Major Spending Categories:**\n\n  1. **Ecosystem Grants** (30-50% of spending):\n     - Developer grants for protocol integrations, tools, applications\n     - Research grants for protocol analysis, economic modeling, security audits\n     - Community grants for content creation, events, education\n     - Examples: Uniswap Grants ($74M), Compound Grants ($42M), Aave Grants ($26M)\n\n  2. **Liquidity Mining Incentives** (20-40% of spending):\n     - Token emissions to liquidity providers, users, borrowers/lenders\n     - Goal: Bootstrap protocol usage, acquire users, deepen liquidity\n     - Risk: Mercenary capital (users farm and dump), unsustainable emission rates\n     - Examples: Curve gauge emissions, Aave staking rewards, Compound COMP distribution\n\n  3. **Protocol Development** (15-25% of spending):\n     - Core protocol development teams\n     - Security audits and bug bounties\n     - Infrastructure and hosting costs\n     - Examples: Protocol Labs (Filecoin), Ethereum Foundation, Uniswap Labs (historically)\n\n  4. **Legal and Regulatory** (5-10% of spending):\n     - Legal entity establishment and maintenance (foundations, LLCs)\n     - Regulatory compliance and licensing\n     - Policy advocacy and lobbying\n     - Litigation defense (SEC enforcement, competitor lawsuits)\n\n  5. **Marketing and Growth** (5-15% of spending):\n     - Community events and conferences\n     - Marketing campaigns and partnerships\n     - Educational content and documentation\n     - Ambassador and influencer programs\n\n  **Grant Program Implementations:**\n\n  **Uniswap Grants Program:**\n  - **Budget**: $74M UNI allocated over 4 years (2021-2025)\n  - **Administration**: Uniswap Foundation operates via multisig within community-approved budget\n  - **Focus**: Developer tools, analytics, security, governance participation\n  - **Process**: Applications reviewed quarterly, approved grants announced publicly\n  - **Accountability**: Annual reports to community, renewal requires governance vote\n\n  **Compound Grants Program:**\n  - **Budget**: $42M in COMP (initial allocation), renewed multiple times\n  - **Administration**: Compound Grants Program multisig (elected by governance)\n  - **Focus**: DeFi integrations, developer tools, educational content, security\n  - **Process**: Rolling applications, grants typically $5K-250K\n  - **Innovation**: Pioneered DAO grants model influencing entire ecosystem\n\n  **Gitcoin Grants (Quadratic Funding):**\n  - **Model**: Community donates to public goods projects, matching pool amplifies donations quadratically\n  - **Funding**: Ethereum Foundation, Protocol Labs, and various DAOs contribute to matching pools ($5-10M per round)\n  - **Mechanism**: Quadratic funding favors projects with broad support over whale-funded projects\n  - **Impact**: Funded hundreds of Ethereum ecosystem projects (wallets, dev tools, research, education)\n\n  ### Treasury Security and Risk Management\n\n  DAO treasuries face unique security challenges beyond traditional corporate finance:\n\n  **Multi-Signature Custody Risks:**\n\n  - **Signer key compromise**: If attacker obtains M private keys from N signers, entire treasury is vulnerable\n  - **Signer collusion**: Malicious majority of signers could steal funds (mitigated via reputation, geographic distribution, organizational diversity)\n  - **Signer unavailability**: If too many signers lose keys or become unavailable, treasury is frozen (mitigated via signer rotation policies)\n  - **Social engineering**: Attackers target signers via phishing, impersonation, or coercion\n\n  **Historical Security Incidents:**\n\n  - **Ronin Bridge (2022)**: $625M stolen after attackers compromised 5 of 9 validator keys (not DAO treasury per se, but multisig architecture)\n  - **Poly Network (2021)**: $611M exploited via signature verification bug (funds returned by whitehat hacker)\n  - **Numerous smaller DAOs**: Treasury drains via governance attacks, multisig compromises, smart contract exploits\n\n  **Risk Mitigation Strategies:**\n\n  1. **Hardware wallet requirements**: All signers use hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor), never hot wallets or browser extensions\n\n  2. **Geographic distribution**: Signers located across timezones/jurisdictions, reducing coordinated attack risk\n\n  3. **Organizational diversity**: Mix of protocol team, independent community members, professional services firms\n\n  4. **Timelocks for large transactions**: Even multisig-approved large withdrawals enter timelock period (community can trigger emergency response)\n\n  5. **Insurance**: Some DAOs purchase DeFi insurance (Nexus Mutual, Sherlock) covering treasury exploits\n\n  6. **Regular audits**: Third-party security audits of treasury contracts, signer key management practices\n\n  7. **Transaction simulation**: All treasury transactions simulated on testnet/Tenderly before mainnet execution\n\n  8. **Emergency pause mechanisms**: Ability to freeze treasury contracts if exploit detected\n\n  ### Treasury Transparency and Accountability\n\n  DAO treasuries provide unprecedented financial transparency:\n\n  **Public Dashboards:**\n\n  Every DAO treasury transaction is publicly viewable:\n  - **MakerDAO**: https://makerburn.com (real-time reserves, collateral, surplus buffer)\n  - **Uniswap**: https://info.uniswap.org/#/ (protocol metrics, treasury value)\n  - **Aave**: https://governance.aave.com (treasury composition, proposals, votes)\n  - **DeepDAO**: https://deepdao.io (aggregated DAO treasury data)\n\n  **Quarterly Financial Reports:**\n\n  Many mature DAOs publish detailed financial statements:\n  - **Assets and liabilities**: Treasury composition by asset, chain, custody method\n  - **Revenue and expenses**: Protocol fees earned, operational costs, grant spending\n  - **Cash flow projections**: Runway calculations, sustainability analysis\n  - **Audit reports**: Third-party financial and security audits\n\n  **Comparison to Traditional Corporate Finance:**\n\n  - **DAOs**: Every transaction public in real-time, anyone can audit treasury at any moment\n  - **Public Companies**: Quarterly 10-Q filings (45 days after quarter end), annual 10-K filings, audited by certified accountants\n  - **Private Companies**: No public disclosure requirements beyond tax filings\n\n  DAO transparency far exceeds public company standards, creating accountability whilst exposing treasuries to front-running and strategic exploitation.\n\n  ### Legal and Tax Considerations\n\n  DAO treasury ownership creates novel legal questions:\n\n  **Legal Ownership:**\n\n  - **Unincorporated DAO**: Treasury legally owned by token holders as unincorporated association (potentially unlimited personal liability)\n  - **DAO LLC (Wyoming)**: Treasury owned by legal entity, limited liability for members\n  - **Foundation (Switzerland, Cayman, Marshall Islands)**: Treasury owned by non-profit foundation, DAO token holders are beneficiaries but not legal owners\n  - **Protocol Treasury vs Community Treasury**: Some DAOs distinguish protocol-owned assets (backing protocol operations) from community treasury (governed by token holders)\n\n  **Tax Implications:**\n\n  - **Treasury income**: Are protocol fees taxable income when earned? When distributed? Unclear guidance.\n  - **Token sales**: OTC treasury diversification sales likely taxable events (capital gains on sold tokens, income from received stablecoins?)\n  - **Grant spending**: Are grants tax-deductible expenses? Recipients owe income tax on grants received?\n  - **Jurisdiction**: Where is DAO treasury taxed? Location of legal entity? Location of signers? All jurisdictions where token holders reside?\n\n  Most major DAOs established legal entities (foundations, LLCs) partially to address these questions, though significant ambiguity remains.\n\n  ### Best Practices for DAO Treasury Management\n\n  Based on 2020-2025 ecosystem experience:\n\n  1. **Diversify beyond native tokens**: Target 40-60% native token maximum, diversify into stablecoins, ETH/BTC, RWAs to reduce volatility\n\n  2. **Establish legal entity**: Wyoming DAO LLC, Swiss Foundation, or Marshall Islands non-profit provides legal personality, limited liability, tax clarity\n\n  3. **Use battle-tested multisig**: Gnosis Safe is industry standard, avoid custom treasury contracts unless thoroughly audited\n\n  4. **Implement tiered governance**: Small spending via multisig, large spending requires full governance vote\n\n  5. **Maintain operational runway**: Hold 2-4 years operational expenses in stablecoins to survive bear markets\n\n  6. **Generate yield on idle assets**: Deploy stablecoins in low-risk yield strategies (Aave, Compound, RWAs) rather than holding idle\n\n  7. **Transparent reporting**: Publish quarterly financial reports, maintain public dashboards, enable community oversight\n\n  8. **Progressive decentralization**: Start with foundation/team control, gradually transition to community governance as ecosystem matures\n\n  9. **Insurance and security**: Consider DeFi insurance, require hardware wallets for all signers, implement timelocks for large transactions\n\n  10. **Professional treasury management**: Hire or delegate treasury management to professionals (Llama, Steakhouse Financial) for complex portfolios\n\n  ### Future Developments\n\n  **Institutional Treasury Services**: Traditional financial institutions (Coinbase Institutional, Anchorage Digital, Fidelity Digital Assets) increasingly offer DAO treasury custody, creating bridge to tradfi whilst potentially centralizing custody.\n\n  **Automated Treasury Management**: AI-driven treasury optimization determining ideal asset allocation, rebalancing schedules, and yield strategies based on market conditions and DAO goals.\n\n  **Cross-Chain Treasury Coordination**: As DAOs operate multi-chain, treasuries will span Ethereum, L2s, and other chains, requiring cross-chain accounting, coordination, and consolidated dashboards.\n\n  **Regulatory Compliance**: Clearer frameworks for DAO treasury taxation, reporting requirements, and fiduciary duties will emerge through 2025-2027.\n\n  **Treasury Tokens**: Experimentation with treasury-backed tokens where value is explicitly backed by DAO treasury assets (similar to mutual fund shares).\n\n  #\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable\n\n\n## References and Case Studies\n\n  - [[BC-0461-decentralized-autonomous-organization]]\n  - [[BC-0462-on-chain-voting]]\n  - [[BC-0463-governance-token]]\n  - [[BC-0465-proposal-system]]\n  - [[BC-0142-smart-contract]]\n  - [[MakerDAO Treasury]]\n  - [[Uniswap Treasury Allocation]]\n  - [[Compound Grants Program]]\n  - [[Gnosis Safe]]\n  - [[Real-World Assets]]\n  - [[Protocol-Owned Liquidity]]\n\n  ### Original Content\n    collapsed:: true\n\t- ```\n\n\t  ```",
