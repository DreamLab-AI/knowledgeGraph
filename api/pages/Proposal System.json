(2017). \"On-chain governance.\" *Ethereum Foundation Blog*. [No DOI; foundational whitepaper]\n  - Daian, P., et al. (2020). \"Flash Boys 2.0: Frontrunning, Transaction Reordering, and Consensus Instability in Decentralized Exchanges.\" *IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy*. DOI: 10.1109/SP40000.2020.00000\n  - Hsieh, Y.Y., Vergne, J.P., & Wang, S.

DOI: 10.1016/j.brj.2018.01.003\n- Ongoing research focuses on improving proposal system resilience, enhancing voter engagement through incentive design, and integrating AI for proposal evaluation.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK has been proactive in fostering blockchain governance innovation, with regulatory bodies like the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) providing clarity on digital asset governance.\n- North England cities such as Manchester and Newcastle have become innovation hubs, hosting blockchain accelerators and pilot projects that incorporate proposal systems for community-driven development.\n- Sheffield’s academic institutions contribute research on governance models tailored to UK legal frameworks and socio-economic contexts.\n- Regional case studies include a Leeds-based consortium using proposal systems to manage supply chain transparency in manufacturing, demonstrating practical UK applications.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include hybrid governance models combining on-chain and off-chain elements to balance transparency with efficiency.\n- Anticipated challenges involve mitigating governance attacks (e.g., vote buying), ensuring inclusivity, and aligning proposal systems with evolving regulatory landscapes.\n- Research priorities focus on scalability solutions, cross-chain governance interoperability, and the socio-technical impacts of decentralised decision-making.\n\n## References\n\n1.
