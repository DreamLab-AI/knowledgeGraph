Building upon the foundation laid by its predecessor, Mamba, this architecture tackles the inherent computational challenges of sequence modelling, particularly for long sequences, by introducing a series of innovations that leverage the power of modern hardware. This section delves into the technical intricacies of Mamba2, guided by the insights from the paper \"Transformers are SSMs: Generalised Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality\".\n\t\t\t\t- ## Bridging the Gap: SSMs, Attention, and Structured Matrices\n\t\t\t\t\t- Before diving into the specifics of Mamba2, the paper establishes a crucial theoretical framework that connects three seemingly disparate concepts: structured state space models (SSMs), attention mechanisms, and structured matrices. This framework, termed \"structured state space duality\" (SSD), lays the groundwork for understanding the core innovations of Mamba2 and its relationship to existing sequence modelling paradigms.\n\t\t\t\t\t- The paper reveals a fundamental truth about SSMs: they can be viewed as matrix transformations operating on input sequences. This insight reframes the computation of SSMs as a matrix multiplication problem, where the matrix itself exhibits a specific structure known as semiseparability. Semiseparable matrices are characterized by low-rank submatrices, a property that Mamba2 cleverly exploits for efficiency gains.\n\t\t\t\t\t- A particularly important class of semiseparable matrices, the 1-semiseparable matrices, take center stage in understanding the efficiency of autoregressive sequence modelling. These matrices correspond to simple scalar recurrences, the building blocks of many efficient SSM algorithms. The paper demonstrates that the efficient computation of autoregressive attention, a crucial capability for language modelling, is intrinsically linked to the properties of semiseparable matrices.\n\t\t\t\t- ## Mamba2's Core: The State Space Dual (SSD) Layer\n\t\t\t\t\t- The heart of Mamba2 lies in the State Space Dual (SSD) layer, a refined core SSM layer that replaces the S6 layer from Mamba. This layer embodies the principle of sacrificing some expressivity for substantial gains in computational efficiency, achieved by:\n\t\t\t\t\t- Unlike Mamba, which allows each element in the state vector to decay independently, Mamba2 groups these elements into chunks and applies the same decay factor to each chunk. This seemingly minor modification unlocks significant speedups by allowing the algorithm to leverage matrix multiplications, operations highly optimised on modern hardware like GPUs with their specialised tensor cores.\n\t\t\t\t\t- The chunking strategy in the SSD layer allows Mamba2 to embrace the computational power of matrix multiplications. This shift away from element-wise operations, which are less efficient on modern hardware, results in substantial reductions in training time. The paper's benchmarks show the SSD algorithm to be 2-8x faster than Mamba's optimised selective scan implementation.\n\t\t\t\t\t- While the reduced granularity of state decay in the SSD layer might appear to limit the model's expressivity, the paper argues that this can also be viewed as a form of inductive bias. By constraining the model's flexibility, the chunking strategy might actually guide it towards learning more generalisable representations, potentially improving performance on certain tasks.\n\t\t\t\t- ## Beyond the SSD Layer: Architectural Enhancements\n\t\t\t\t\t- Mamba2 goes beyond the SSD layer, incorporating architectural refinements inspired by the established techniques and understanding of attention mechanisms in Transformers:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Sequence Parallelism:** Mamba2 enables splitting the input sequence into smaller chunks and processing them concurrently across multiple devices. This technique is a natural extension of the block decomposition strategy used in the SSD algorithm, further enhancing efficiency for long sequences.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Tensor Parallelism:** The computationally intensive matrix multiplications within Mamba2 are distributed across multiple devices, accelerating training and paving the way for training even larger models. The Mamba2 block is specifically designed to minimise synchronisation points, reducing communication overhead and maximising parallel efficiency.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Parallel Parameter Projections:** Mamba2 streamlines the computation of SSM parameters (A, B, C, X) by computing them in parallel at the beginning of the block, a departure from Mamba's sequential approach. This simplification contributes to faster training and aligns better with parallelisation strategies commonly used in Transformers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Extra Normalisation:** An additional normalisation layer, such as LayerNorm, GroupNorm, or RMSNorm, is strategically placed before the final output projection to enhance training stability. This addition proves especially beneficial for larger Mamba2 models, mitigating potential instabilities that can arise during training.\n\t\t\t\t- ## Multi-head Patterns: Learning from Transformers\n\t\t\t\t\t- Mamba2 leverages the concept of multi-head attention, a cornerstone of Transformer architectures, to create multiple \"heads\" of its sequence transformation. Each head operates on a portion of the input sequence with its own set of parameters, allowing the model to capture diverse aspects of the sequential data.\n\t\t\t\t\t- The paper reveals a key difference between SSMs and Transformers in how they implement multi-head computations. Mamba2, like its predecessor, adopts a \"multi-value attention\" (MVA) pattern, where the expansion and contraction matrices (B and C) are shared across all heads. This pattern, a natural outcome of the SSM formulation, stands in contrast to the multi-query attention (MQA) pattern commonly used in Transformers. Empirical evidence suggests that the MVA pattern, unique to SSMs, might contribute to Mamba2's strong performance.\n\t\t\t\t- ## Trade-offs, Potentials, and Open Questions\n\t\t\t\t\t- Despite its advancements, Mamba2 is not without its trade-offs and areas for further exploration.\n\t\t\t\t\t- While Mamba2 excels in training efficiency, its impact on inference speed remains an open question. This aspect is particularly crucial for real-world applications where fast inference is paramount. Further research is needed to investigate how to optimise Mamba2 specifically for inference, potentially through state size adjustments or by leveraging specialised hardware.\n\t\t\t\t\t- The reduced expressivity of the SSD layer, a consequence of its chunking strategy, is an area that demands deeper understanding. While the paper offers a compelling argument for this as a form of inductive bias, a more detailed analysis is needed to ascertain its impact on specific tasks. Exploring whether this trade-off consistently yields benefits across diverse sequence modelling problems is a crucial direction for future research.\n\t\t\t\t\t- The paper hints at the potential of hybrid architectures that combine the strengths of both SSD layers and attention mechanisms. Initial results suggest that a judicious blend of these two paradigms can lead to models that outperform both pure Transformer and pure Mamba2 architectures. Further research into the optimal balance and placement of these layers within a hybrid architecture is a promising avenue for achieving even better performance and efficiency.\n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- # Things to do\n\t\t\t\t- TODO What is the spatial and temporal resolution of the space-acquired data?\n\t\t\t\t- TODO How far back does the historical data go, and at what resolution?\n\t\t\t\t- TODO Are there any specific climate variables or phenomena of interest (e.g., temperature, precipitation, extreme events)?\n\t\t\t\t- TODO What is the desired output format for the predictive component (e.g., short-term forecasts, long-term projections)?\n\t\t\t\t- TODO Handling data quality issues (e.g., cloud cover, sensor noise)\n\t\t\t\t- TODO Incorporating domain knowledge (e.g., physical constraints, climate models)\n\t\t\t\t- TODO Leveraging transfer learning from pre-trained models on similar datasets\n\t\t\t\t- TODO Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics and validation techniques\n\t\t\t\t- TODO Interpreting and visualizing the learned representations for stakeholder communication\n\t\t- ## Ontological Layer for Metaverse\n\t\t\t- To approach the problem of using Mamba to analyze formal ontological graphs as used by the W3C, we can draw upon several techniques and architectures discussed in the Mamba literature.

Here are the key points about KANs:\n\t- Inspiration and design:\n\t\t- KANs are inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem from the 1950s[](https://theaiinsider.tech/2024/05/27/what-are-kolmogorov-arnold-networks-a-guide-to-what-might-be-the-next-big-thing-in-artificial-intelligence/)[](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.19756v4).\n\t\t- Unlike traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) that have fixed activation functions on nodes, KANs have learnable activation functions on edges[](https://theaiinsider.tech/2024/05/27/what-are-kolmogorov-arnold-networks-a-guide-to-what-might-be-the-next-big-thing-in-artificial-intelligence/)[](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.19756v4).\n\t- Key differences from MLPs:\n\t\t- KANs replace linear weights with univariate functions parametrized as splines[](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1chrafb/r_kan_kolmogorovarnold_networks/).\n\t\t- They have no linear weights at all - every weight parameter is a learnable univariate function[](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1chrafb/r_kan_kolmogorovarnold_networks/).\n\t- Potential advantages:\n\t\t- Improved accuracy: Smaller KANs can achieve comparable or better accuracy than larger MLPs in data fitting and PDE solving[](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1chrafb/r_kan_kolmogorovarnold_networks/).\n\t\t- Better interpretability: KANs can be intuitively visualized and easily interact with human users[](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1chrafb/r_kan_kolmogorovarnold_networks/).\n\t\t- Faster neural scaling laws: KANs potentially scale better than traditional neural networks[](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1chrafb/r_kan_kolmogorovarnold_networks/)[](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.19756v4).\n\t- Applications:\n\t\t- KANs show promise in image processing, speech recognition, and financial modeling[](https://theaiinsider.tech/2024/05/27/what-are-kolmogorov-arnold-networks-a-guide-to-what-might-be-the-next-big-thing-in-artificial-intelligence/).\n\t\t- They have been used to help scientists (re)discover mathematical and physical laws[](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1chrafb/r_kan_kolmogorovarnold_networks/).\n\t- Challenges:\n\t\t- KANs are more complex to design and implement than traditional neural networks[](https://theaiinsider.tech/2024/05/27/what-are-kolmogorov-arnold-networks-a-guide-to-what-might-be-the-next-big-thing-in-artificial-intelligence/).\n\t\t- They require specialized knowledge and are not yet widely adopted[](https://theaiinsider.tech/2024/05/27/what-are-kolmogorov-arnold-networks-a-guide-to-what-might-be-the-next-big-thing-in-artificial-intelligence/).\n\t\t- Training speed is currently slower (about 10 times) compared to MLPs of the same size[](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1chrafb/r_kan_kolmogorovarnold_networks/).\n\t- Implementation:\n\t\t- A Python library called \"pykan\" is available for implementing KANs[](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1chrafb/r_kan_kolmogorovarnold_networks/)\n\t\t  \n\t\t  4\n\t\t  \n\t\t  .\n\t\t  \n\t\t  While KANs show promising results and potential advantages over traditional neural networks, they are still in the early stages of development and research. Further studies and real-world applications are needed to fully understand their capabilities and limitations compared to established neural network architectures.\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
