Hashes represent product classes or categories of product that are interesting to the user (opt in)\n\t- ### Nostr Integration\n\t\t- User's device includes a [[Nostr protocol]] client to interact with the decentralised Nostr network.\n\t\t- The Nostr client accesses the local knowledge base to retrieve relevant product class hashes.\n\t\t- These hashes are used to pull personalised marketing content from the Nostr network.\n\t- ### Embedding in User-Side Applications\n\t\t- Personalised marketing content is seamlessly embedded into the user's preferred applications, such as Roblox, [[NVIDIA Omniverse]] , and web browsers.\n\t\t  This ensures relevant and engaging marketing content within the context of the user's usual digital experiences.\n\t- ### Marketer-Side Components\n\t\t- [[Multimodal]] Product Representation\n\t\t- Marketers create rich, multi-modal representations of their products, capturing visual appearance, textual descriptions, and other relevant attributes.\n\t\t  These are [[Training and fine tuning]] using AI to generate variations catering to different user preferences and demographics.\n\t- ### Cloud-Based Latent Space\n\t\t- Fine-tuned product variations are stored in a cloud-based [[latent space]] , a high-dimensional vector space where each point represents a specific product variation.\n\t\t- This [[latent space]] is organised and indexed for efficient retrieval based on user preferences.\n\t- ### Nostr Network Distribution and Support\n\t\t- Marketers distribute product variations across a cloud of [[Nostr]] servers, each variation associated with a unique Nostr event containing metadata and content.\n\t\t- The Nostr servers act as a decentralised storage and distribution network for marketing content.\n\t\t- Advertisers and brand leaders support the Nostr network by subsidising network nodes, helping maintain network infrastructure and incentivising node operators.\n\t- ### Interaction Flow\n\t\t- The user's device, with a Nostr client, accesses the local knowledge base to retrieve relevant product class hashes.\n\t\t- These hashes are used to pull personalised marketing content from the Nostr network, which matches hashes with corresponding product variations in the cloud-based latent space.\n\t\t- The matched product variations are then returned to the user's device via the Nostr network, ensuring the marketer has no direct access to the user's personal information or identity.\n\t- ### Benefits and Considerations\n\t\t- #### User Privacy\n\t\t- The user's knowledge base is kept local to their device, using hashes to retrieve personalised content, which enhances [[Politics, Law, Privacy]] by avoiding centralized data collection and tracking.\n\t\t- [[Hyper personalisation]] and Dynamic Creative Optimisation (DCO)\n\t\t- The system delivers content optimised for the user's language, environment, age, and other demographic factors using AI-powered multi-modal product representations.\n\t\t- DCO techniques dynamically adapt and optimise creative elements in real-time based on user interactions and preferences.\n\t\t- #### Scalability and Efficiency\n\t\t- The [[Decentralised Web]] Nostr architecture allows for efficient distribution and retrieval of marketing content.\n\t\t- Advertiser subsidies help maintain a robust and reliable network infrastructure.\n\t\t- ### Integration and User Experience\n\t\t- Personalised marketing content is embedded into the user's preferred applications for a seamless experience.\n\t\t   Ethical Considerations\n\t\t- It's crucial to ensure user awareness and consent for using the local knowledge base for personalised marketing.\n\t\t- Implement clear communication and opt-in mechanisms for transparency and user control.\n\t\t- #### Measurement and Analytics\n\t\t- The exploration of privacy-preserving measurement techniques allows for aggregate insights without compromising individual user privacy.\n\t\t- #### Ecosystem Sustainability\n\t\t- Advertiser subsidies contribute to the long-term sustainability and growth of the Nostr network, fostering a mutually beneficial ecosystem.\n\t\t- #### Future Vision\n\t\t- The system aims to expand advertiser participation and subsidies to strengthen the Nostr network infrastructure further.\n\t\t- Collaboration with the Nostr community and stakeholders will refine the system's design and drive adoption.\n\t\t- Advanced AI and ML techniques will enhance [[Hyper personalisation]] and DCO capabilities, fostering a thriving ecosystem benefiting from a privacy-focused approach. -\n- #
