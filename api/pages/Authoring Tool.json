Authoring tools for immersive content have evolved from niche game development utilities to essential platforms for metaverse creation, supporting the design of 3D environments, interactive assets, and user experiences.\n  - The academic foundation lies at the intersection of computer graphics, human-computer interaction, and digital media studies, with increasing emphasis on interoperability and user-centric design.\n\n- Key developments and current state\n  - Modern authoring tools now integrate AI-driven asset generation, real-time collaboration, and blockchain-based asset management, reflecting broader trends in digital content creation.\n  - Research continues to focus on lowering technical barriers for non-specialist creators and improving cross-platform compatibility.\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Leading platforms such as Unity, Unreal Engine, and open-source frameworks like Ethereal Engine (XREngine) and Webaverse are widely used for metaverse authoring.\n  - Commercial and creative sectors increasingly rely on these tools for virtual events, digital twins, and immersive training simulations.\n\n- Notable organisations and platforms\n  - Unity Technologies and Epic Games remain dominant, with growing adoption of open-source alternatives such as Ethereal Engine and Webaverse.\n  - UK-based studios and agencies, including those in Manchester and Leeds, are leveraging these tools for creative projects and enterprise solutions.\n\n- UK and North England examples where relevant\n  - Manchester’s MediaCityUK hosts several digital innovation labs using Unity and Unreal for immersive storytelling and virtual production.\n  - Leeds-based creative agencies have developed metaverse experiences for cultural heritage and education, often collaborating with local universities.\n  - Newcastle and Sheffield are emerging as regional hubs for digital arts and immersive technology, with local councils supporting metaverse initiatives for urban planning and community engagement.\n\n- Technical capabilities and limitations\n  - Modern authoring tools support real-time rendering, physics simulation, and multi-user collaboration, but challenges remain in asset interoperability and performance optimisation across devices.\n  - Integration with blockchain and AI is improving, though standardisation and user experience consistency are ongoing concerns.\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Industry standards such as glTF for 3D assets and WebXR for browser-based experiences are increasingly adopted.\n  - Open-source frameworks like Ethereal Engine promote interoperability and community-driven development.\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers and sources\n  - Damer, B.
