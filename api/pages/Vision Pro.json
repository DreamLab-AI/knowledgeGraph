I think they'll continue to support it, just there's not enough new technology the warrant anything \"next\", and famously No Moores Law In Optics\n- https://www.optica-opn.org/home/newsroom/2019/september/no_moore_s_law_in_optics/\n- The thermodynamics of the processing isn't getting much better, while the AI workloads ARE getting much bigger. Denser batteries are mooted but not available. They have \"maxed out\" around here, so they have to stop. Meanwhile there's just not market (really) for the one they have built. They can remain committed to the concept longer than the market can stay rational.\n- I think these things will eventually happen, but Meta accidentally stumbled on the likely direction of travel with the Ray Ban things. People who try the FRAME I bought, hacky and slow though it is, immediately \"sense\" the utility. People get tired of wow from heavy headsets. There's just not quite enough \"there there\".\n- # The good\n\t- Generally agreed to be the best technical attempt at a commercial headset\n\t- Exceptional space awareness.\n- # The bad\n\t- **Price**: $3,500 is very expensive, especially for a Gen 1 product.\n\t- **App Store Restrictions**: Not available outside the US without an American Apple ID.\n\t- **Heavy and Bulky**: Takes up significant space, uncomfortable for long sessions.\n\t- **Light Seal Design**: Weak magnets, often feels like it's going to break.\n\t- **Battery Dependency**: Requires the battery pack, no internal battery.\n\t- **Limited USB-C Port**: Only for charging, cannot connect to other devices.\n\t- **Motion Blur**: Using on a train or in motion causes blurriness and nausea.\n\t- **Field of View**: Feels like looking through binoculars, can feel tunnel-visioned.\n\t- **Heat and Discomfort**: Gets heavy and uncomfortable over time, especially for workouts.\n\t- **Sound Leakage**: Built-in speakers leak sound, potentially disturbing others.\n\t- **Limited Gaming**: Not many VR games compared to other VR platforms.\n\t- **No Window Management**: Inability to save window setups, basic interface.\n\t- **Share Experience**: Difficult to share experience with others easily.\n\t- **Productivity Issues**: Feels less productive compared to traditional setups.\n\t- **Public Use**: Looks awkward and attracts attention when used outside.\n- {{twitter https://twitter.com/tkexpress11/status/1780566909957910682?}}\n- [The Vision Pro is a big flop (disconnect.blog)](https://disconnect.blog/the-vision-pro-is-a-big-flop/)\n- [Apple can readily afford this experiment, they are operating at such scale that failure of the Vision Pro is meaningless](https://www.engadget.com/it-doesnt-matter-how-many-vision-pro-headsets-apple-sells-ming-chi-kuo-production-numbers-143112470.html?guccounter=1)\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
