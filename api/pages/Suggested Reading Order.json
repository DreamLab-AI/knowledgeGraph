If you want upskilling on these things then I can give a physical or remote tour through the subset of knowledge that's right for -your- company or personal research needs. Afterwards, you will get a link to a page on my website which contains the knowledge graph suitable for you to extend and build upon the presentation.\n- This graph is also the engine behind another new project we're starting; avatar based conversational agents backed by this knowledgebase, under [[Dreamlab]]\n- # Suggested Order\n\t- I originally started this [as a book.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09460), so there **is** a natural reading order of sorts. I am still working on making this more of a \"flow\" so if it looks wrong just skip about. Some of these high level pages are dozens of pages each, and there are hundreds of such pages, with only a few highlighted here.\n\t- There's possibly around 1000 book equivalent pages overall.\n\t- ## Preamble\n\t\t- [[Introduction to me]] explains my research at a very high level\n\t- ### Web things\n\t\t- [[Semantic Web]]\n\t\t- [[Spatial Web]]\n\t\t- [[Decentralised Web]]\n\t\t- [[Politics, Law, Privacy]]\n\t- ## Decentralisation\n\t\t- [[Blockchain]]\n\t\t- [[Ethereum]]\n\t\t- [[Bitcoin]]\n\t\t- [[Lightning and Similar L2]]\n\t\t- [[BTC Layer 3]]\n\t\t- [[RGB]]\n\t\t- [[Nostr protocol]]\n\t\t- [[Digital Asset Risks]]\n\t\t- [[NFTs]]\n\t\t- [[Digital Objects]]\n\t- ## Money and Value\n\t\t- [[Bitcoin As Money]]\n\t\t- [[Money]]\n\t- ## Identity\n\t\t- [[Distributed Identity]]\n\t- ## Digital Objects\n\t\t- [[NFTs]]\n\t\t- [[Digital Objects]]\n\t- ## Spatial\n\t\t- [[Metaverse and Telecollaboration]]\n\t\t- [[Definitions and frameworks for Metaverse]]\n\t\t- [[Spatial Computing]]\n\t\t- [[Metaverse and Spatial Risks]]\n\t- ## Artificial Intelligence\n\t\t- [[Overview of Machine Learning Techniques]]\n\t\t- [[Proprietary Large Language Models]]\n\t\t- [[Proprietary Image Generation]]\n\t\t- [[Proprietary Video]]\n\t\t- [[Open Generative AI tools]]\n\t\t- [[State of the art in AI]]\n\t\t- [[Adoption of Convergent Technologies]]\n\t\t- [[Soon-Next-Later (AI futurology)]]\n\t\t-\n- This is a very new page and will be subject to a [[Update Cycle]] soon\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
