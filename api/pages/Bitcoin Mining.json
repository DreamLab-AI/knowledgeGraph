These are the [[mining fee]] (also called [[transaction fees]]) and the [[block reward]] (also called the [[block subsidy]]). The [[transactions]] which are added into the next '[[block]]' of the [[chain]] are selected preferentially based on the [[fee]] they offer, which is up to the user trying to get their transaction into the chain. This can be within the next 10 minutes (next block), or a gamble out toward 'never' depending how competitive the [[network]] is at any time. [[Miners]] try to find a sufficiently low result from a [[cryptographic hash function]] [[rogaway2004cryptographic]] (a [[random]] [[process]]), and upon finding it, they can take their pre-prepared '[[block]]' of [[transactions]] sourced from their local queue ([[mempool]]), and add it into the [[chain]], for confirmation by other [[miners]]. In return, they take all the [[fees]] within that mined [[block]], and whatever the [[block reward]] is at the time. When the [[network]] started in 2009, the [[block reward]] was 50 [[Bitcoin]], but has [halved](https://ma.ttias.be/dissecting-code-bitcoin-halving/) repeatedly every 210,000 [[blocks]] (approximately four years) through [[Bitcoin halving]] events and now stands at **3.125 BTC** as of the April 2024 [[halving]]. The rate of [[mining]] is kept roughly at one [[block]] every 10 minutes, by a [[difficulty adjustment]] every 2016 [[blocks]] (2 weeks). This is a complex interdependent mechanism and is explained very well in [this article](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-mining-protects-the-bitcoin-network). These components are explained in slightly more detail later.^[Bitcoin Magazine - How Mining Protects the Bitcoin Network (2023)]\n\t- Chris Kuiper, CFA at [[Fidelity Digital Assets]] - [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fidelitychriskuiper/) - Expert on Bitcoin mining economics and institutional adoption\n\t- ![proofOfWork.mp4](../assets/proofOfWork_1739615182159_0.mp4)\n\n## 2025 Mining Industry Statistics\n\n- **Network Hash Rate**: As of January 2025, the [[Bitcoin]] [[network]] [[hash rate]] has reached **937-976 EH/s** (exahashes per second), representing unprecedented [[security]] and [[mining]] [[power]] distributed globally.^[Bitcoin Mining Council Q4 2024 Report]\n- **Mining Pool Distribution** (2025):\n\t- [[Foundry USA]]: ~30% of global hash rate (leading US-based pool)\n\t- [[AntPool]]: ~25% of global hash rate (China-based but globally distributed)\n\t- [[F2Pool]]: ~15%\n\t- [[Binance Pool]]: ~10%\n\t- Other pools: ~20%\n- **Energy Sustainability**: As of 2025, **52.4%** of [[Bitcoin]] [[mining]] uses [[sustainable energy]] sources, including [[solar]], [[wind]], [[hydro]], and [[nuclear power]].^[Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance 2025]\n- **Geographic Distribution** (2025):\n\t- [[United States]]: 44% (with [[Texas]] representing ~28% of US mining)\n\t- [[China]]: 15% (underground operations post-ban)\n\t- [[Kazakhstan]]: 8%\n\t- [[Russia]]: 7%\n\t- [[Canada]]: 6%\n\t- Other regions: 20%\n- **ASIC Efficiency Improvements** (2025):\n\t- Leading [[ASIC]] miners now achieve **20-25 J/TH** (joules per terahash), compared to 30-35 J/TH in 2023\n\t- [[Bitmain Antminer S21]] series: 17.5 J/TH\n\t- [[MicroBT Whatsminer M60]] series: 18 J/TH\n\t- Next-generation 3nm chips expected to reach 15 J/TH by late 2025\n- **Immersion Cooling Adoption**: **39%** of large-scale [[mining]] facilities now use [[immersion cooling]] technology, reducing energy consumption by 15-20% and enabling higher [[ASIC]] density.^[Luxor Technology 2025 Mining Report]\n\n## AI and Machine Learning in Bitcoin Mining (2025)\n\nThe integration of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] into [[Bitcoin]] [[mining]] operations has accelerated dramatically in 2024-2025, with **28% of large mining companies** (those with >100 MW capacity) now deploying AI-powered optimization systems.^[HashRate Index AI Mining Survey 2024]\n\n### AI-Powered Mining Optimization\n\n- **Predictive Analytics for Pool Selection**: [[Machine learning]] algorithms analyze historical [[mining pool]] performance, [[fee structures]], [[payout variance]], and [[network conditions]] to automatically switch pools for optimal profitability.

However, with 52.4% sustainable energy mix, the [[carbon footprint]] has decreased 37% since 2021 despite hash rate increasing 4x.^[Bitcoin Mining Council Q4 2024 Sustainability Report]\n\t  ![image](./assets/02b34adaad63fc8abdf4a851df584c5a74825102.jpg){:height 616, :width 1026}\n\t  ![image](./assets/5fd0c12ed090d4eb415c03ccc2cecb522eff6ef8.jpg)\n### Industrial Scale Mining Operations (2025)\n\n- [[Bitcoin]] [[mining]] is an [industrial scale](https://www.ruetir.com/2022/03/18/riot-whinstone-the-bitcoin-farm-with-100000-computers-that-uses-excess-energy-from-an-oil-platform-to-mine-cryptocurrencies-ruetir/) global business with '[[mining companies]]' investing [hundreds of millions of dollars](https://ir.marathondh.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1272/marathon-digital-holdings-bitcoin-mining-fleet-to-reach) at a time in specialist [[ASIC]] (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) [[mining hardware]] and [[facilities]]. Major public companies like [[Marathon Digital Holdings]], [[Riot Platforms]], [[CleanSpark]], and [[Core Scientific]] operate facilities with 100+ MW capacity. This is \"[[proof of work]]\" and is essential to the [[technology]], and is still thought by some to be the [best available option](https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/pow-cheapest/) for [[decentralized]] [[consensus]].^[Truthcoin - Why Proof-of-Work is the Cheapest]\n- The [Cambridge Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index](https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index) monitors this [[energy usage]]. Their [2025 report](https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index) confirms [[American]] [[mining]] leads globally at 44% of hash rate, up from 38% in 2022. The mining industry consolidated significantly in 2022-2023 following the [[bear market]] and [[FTX collapse]], with many overleveraged companies declaring bankruptcy. However, 2024-2025 has seen recovery with institutional investment returning and focus on [[energy efficiency]], [[grid services]], and [[sustainable mining]].^[Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance Bitcoin Mining Report 2025]\n\t\t- ![image.png](../assets/image_1742062864795_0.png)\n### Mining Profitability and Market Structure (2025)\n\n- As of early 2025, the most profitable [[miners]] are predominantly large-scale companies providing [[demand response]] and [[load balancing services]] to [[energy companies]] and [[grid operators]]. This dual-revenue model (Bitcoin rewards + grid services payments) has become standard practice, particularly in [[Texas]] ([[ERCOT]] grid) where [[miners]] can earn $150,000-400,000 per MW per year from [[demand response programs]].^[ERCOT Demand Response Report 2024] This concentration is unusual in the history of [[mining]], and the situation will likely change over time as [[home mining]] and [[community mining]] evolve with more efficient [[ASIC chips]].\n- This is not to say that all [[mining]] is, or should be, so concentrated. Anyone running the [[hashing algorithm]] can [get lucky](https://twitter.com/ckpooldev/status/1485585814419812356) and claim the [[block reward]] - this happened notably in January 2022 when a solo miner with just 116 TH/s won a full block worth 6.25 BTC (~$270,000 at the time). [[Proof-of-Work]] ties the value of the '[[money]]' component of [[Bitcoin]] directly to [[energy production]]. This is not a new idea. [[Henry Ford]] proposed an intimate tie between [[energy]] and [[money]] to create a separation of [[powers]] from [[government]], as can be seen in Figure <a href=\"#fig:energyNYT\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"fig:energyNYT\">[fig:energyNYT]</a>.^[New York Times - Ford's Energy Dollar Proposal (1921)]\n## Energy Concerns and Regulatory Landscape (2025)\n\n### [[Bitcoin]] and [[Cryptocurrency]] Energy Dynamics:\n- [[Proof-of-work]] [[cryptocurrencies]] like [[Bitcoin]] are [[energy-intensive]] by design to ensure [[security]] and [[decentralization]]\n- [[Mining]] operations compete with other growing sources of [[electricity demand]] ([[data centers]], [[AI training]], [[electric vehicles]]), but enable unique '[[buyer of last resort]]' dynamics that support [[renewable energy]] development\n- [[Mining]] faces varying [[regulatory pressure]] due to [[environmental concerns]] and [[grid constraints]], with contrasting approaches:\n\t- **Supportive jurisdictions**: [[Texas]], [[Wyoming]], [[North Dakota]], [[Montana]] (US); [[Paraguay]], [[El Salvador]] (Latin America); [[UAE]], [[Oman]] (Middle East)\n\t- **Restrictive/banned**: [[China]] (2021 ban, though underground mining persists), [[New York]] (2-year moratorium on fossil fuel mining 2022-2024, extended to 2025)\n\t- **Developing frameworks**: [[European Union]] (MiCA regulation includes mining transparency requirements), [[Canada]], [[Australia]]\n## Technical Mining Process Overview\n\n- [[Bitcoin]] [[mining]] is the [[process]] of adding public [[transactions]] into the [[ledger]], in return for two economic rewards, paid in [[Bitcoin]]. These are the [[mining fee]] (sum of individual [[transaction fees]]), and the [[block reward]] ([[block subsidy]]). The [[transactions]] which are added into the next '[[block]]' of the [[chain]] are selected preferentially based on the [[fee rate]] (satoshis per vbyte) they offer, which is up to the user trying to get their [[transaction]] into the chain. This can be within the next 10 minutes (next block), or extend much longer depending how competitive the [[mempool]] is at any time. [[Miners]] try to find a sufficiently low result from a [[cryptographic hash function]] using [[SHA-256]] (a [[computational]] [[process]]), and upon finding it, they can take their pre-prepared '[[block]]' of [[transactions]] sourced from their local queue ([[mempool]]), and add it into the [[chain]], for confirmation by other [[miners]]. In return they take all the [[fees]] within that mined [[block]], and whatever the [[block reward]] is at the time (currently **3.125 BTC** as of April 2024 [[halving]]). When the [[network]] started in January 2009, the [[block reward]] was 50 [[Bitcoin]], but has [halved](https://ma.ttias.be/dissecting-code-bitcoin-halving/) repeatedly every 210,000 [[blocks]] (approximately four years) and will continue until approximately 2140 when all 21 million [[Bitcoin]] will be mined. The rate of [[mining]] is kept roughly at one [[block]] every 10 minutes through the [[difficulty adjustment algorithm]] that recalculates every 2016 [[blocks]] (2 weeks). This is a complex interdependent mechanism and is explained very well in [this article](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-mining-protects-the-bitcoin-network).^[Bitcoin Magazine - Mining Protection Mechanism] These components are explained in slightly more detail later.\n\t- ## Energy & policy response\n\t\t- ![Figure 3.15: [Bitcoin network vs TOP500 supercomputers](https://twitter.com/blockbain/status/1432824720727105539)](../assets/top500.jpg)\n\t\t- ![Figure 3.16: ](../assets/energycompare.jpg)\n\t\t\t- ![Figure 3.17: [Bitcoin Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/introducing-cbei-a-new-way-to-measure-bitcoin-network-electrical-consumption)](../assets/energyComparison.png)\n### Mining Economics Post-2024 Halving\n\n- Following the April 2024 [[halving]] which reduced the [[block subsidy]] from 6.25 BTC to **3.125 BTC**, [[mining economics]] fundamentally shifted. With [[Bitcoin price]] volatility and reduced [[block rewards]], only the most efficient operations remain profitable without additional [[revenue streams]]. As of 2025, the most successful [[miners]] are those who have:\n\t1. **Dual-revenue models**: [[Bitcoin mining]] + [[grid services]] ([[demand response]], [[frequency regulation]])\n\t2. **Ultra-efficient hardware**: Latest-generation [[ASICs]] (17-20 J/TH) with [[immersion cooling]]\n\t3. **Low-cost energy**: <$0.03/kWh power purchase agreements, often with [[renewable energy]]\n\t4. **Vertical integration**: Direct connections to [[power plants]] or self-generated [[energy]]\n- This concentration is unusual in the history of [[mining]], but [[decentralization]] efforts continue through [[home mining]] innovations (e.g., [[Bitaxe]], [[Apollo BTC]]) and [[community mining pools]].

It's such a great resource we shouldn't turn it down. [[Bitcoin mining]] or what some call crypto has found a way to come into our markets and take some of that wind in off-peak periods. Then when we get to peak period times they are very quick to remove themselves from the market as prices increase. The fact that we can turn down whenever we need the [[power]] for other customers is fantastic. We can use that cryptocurrency to soak up that excess generation when there's a lot of that, and find a home for more [[solar]] and more [[wind]] to come to our grid. Then they reduce consumption when we need that power for other customers. So it's a great balancing act. Most other [[data centers]] (such as [[Microsoft]] or [[Amazon]]) have other customers to serve every other day, so they can't just turn off. But these crypto customers can. If the cost of energy gets too high they can remove themselves from the market. They are also helpful if we lose a [[generator]]. They can quickly respond to that [[frequency]] disruption and allow us to balance our grid.\"^[ERCOT CEO Brad Jones testimony 2022]\n\nBy 2025, this model has proven highly successful:\n- [[Flexible load balancing]] has entered the [mainstream](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemmagreen/2023/01/27/why-no-one-saw-the-success-of-demand-response-coming/?) and gained traction in [[legislative bodies]]\n- This [\"global energy market revolution\"](https://www.citadel21.com/bitcoin-is-the-first-global-market-for-electricity-and-will-unleash-renewables) is analyzed by [[Tabatabai]] of [[Modo Energy]]\n- [[Bitcoin mining]] in [[Texas]] is making the [[grid]] both more reliable and cheaper for consumers - [[ERCOT]] reports 23% reduction in peak demand pricing events since 2022^[ERCOT Annual Report 2024]\n- In the [[UK]], similar problems exist because [[wind power]] is not evenly distributed, and moving it around is complex and expensive, requiring [[gas plants]] for smoothing - [UK Grid Challenges](https://archy.deberker.com/the-uk-is-wasting-a-lot-of-wind-power/)\n### Stranded Energy Mining and Rural Electrification (2025)\n\n- There is significant growth in [[\"stranded energy mining\"]](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-01/oman-backs-u-s-firm-mining-crypto-to-cut-natural-gas-flaring) - utilizing [[energy]] that cannot be effectively transmitted to consumers, thereby monetizing resources that would otherwise be wasted while also [developing power capacity](https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wind-power/900mw-wind-farm-to-power-bitcoin-mining-operation/) without the [usual constraints](https://batcoinz.com/the-renewable-energy-cannot-happen-without-bitcoin-mining%ef%bf%bc/).^[Batcoinz Research - Renewable Energy and Bitcoin Mining]\n\n**Notable 2025 Examples:**\n- [[Gridless]] in [[Kenya]], [[Malawi]], and [[Zambia]]: Harnesses [[hydro power]] in rural African communities, providing [[electricity]] to 12,000+ people while mining [[Bitcoin]].

[[Talen Energy]] owns the adjacent 2.5 GW [[Susquehanna Nuclear Power Plant]]. As of 2025, three 48 MW facilities are fully operational (originally planned capacity), drawing on excess [[power]] from the [[nuclear plant]].\n- Direct connection model: By locating the [[mining facility]] on the combined 1,200-acre campus, there is zero intermediation by legacy [[electric transmission]] and [[distribution]] utilities - the [[mining]] is directly connected to the [[power station]]. This eliminates 8-12% [[transmission losses]] and [[grid fees]].^[TeraWulf Operations Report 2024]\n- [[Cumulus Data]] has identified **23 additional Talen Energy sites** (up from 18 in 2023) with potential to host [[data centers]] directly connected to [[electricity generation]] infrastructure, with 5 under active development.\n\n**Industry Expansion:**\n- [[Oklo Inc.]]: [[Small Modular Reactor]] (SMR) developer partnered with [[Compass Mining]] to deploy 150 MW of [[nuclear]]-powered [[Bitcoin mining]] by 2027\n- [[Ontario]] ([[Canada]]): [[Bruce Nuclear Generating Station]] (world's largest operating [[nuclear plant]]) allocated 100 MW for [[Bitcoin mining]] in 2024, expanded to 200 MW in 2025\n- [[France]]: [[EDF]] (national nuclear operator) pilot program with 50 MW [[Bitcoin mining]] load balancing at 3 facilities\n\n**Nuclear Renaissance and Bitcoin:**\n- Shift in attitudes toward [[nuclear power]] in the [[US]] and globally, driven partly by [[Bitcoin mining]] economics\n- The enormous benefit stems from costs associated with scaling down [[atomic power]] output to match [[grid requirements]].

[[Brad Jones]], [CEO of ERCOT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKnRfDeFgr0), articulated this model in 2022 (see Grid Services section above).\n\t- “As we get more renewable generation, in particular wind, which is operating at night ... we have to find a home for it, otherwise we have to turn the wind down. It’s such a great resource we shouldn’t turn it down. Bitcoin mining, or what some call crypto, has found a way to come into our markets and take some of that wind in off-peak periods. Then when we get to peak period times, they are very quick to remove themselves from the market as prices increase. The fact that we can turn down whenever we need the power for other customers is fantastic. We can use that cryptocurrency to soak up that excess generation when there’s a lot of that, and find a home for more solar and more wind to come to our grid. Then they reduce consumption when we need that power for other customers. So it’s a great balancing act. Most other data centers (such as Microsoft or Amazon) have other customers to serve every other day, so they can’t just turn off. But these crypto customers can. If the cost of energy gets too high, they can remove themselves from the market. They are also helpful if we lose a generator. They can quickly respond to that frequency disruption and allow us to balance our grid.”  Flexible load balancing is entering the [mainstream news cycle](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemmagreen/2023/01/27/why-no-one-saw-the-success-of-demand-response-coming/?) and is gaining traction in legislative bodies. This [“global energy market revolution”](https://www.citadel21.com/bitcoin-is-the-first-global-market-for-electricity-and-will-unleash-renewables) is explained by Tabatabai of Modo Energy. Incredibly, Bitcoin mining in Texas is now making the grid both more reliable and cheaper for consumers. In the UK, we have similar problems because wind power is not evenly distributed, and moving it around is complex and expensive, and the whole system needs smoothing out with [gas plants](https://archy.deberker.com/the-uk-is-wasting-a-lot-of-wind-power/).\n- There is growing interest and adoption of so-called [“stranded energy mining”](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-01/oman-backs-u-s-firm-mining-crypto-to-cut-natural-gas-flaring) which cannot be effectively transmitted to consumers, and is thereby sold at a huge discount while also [developing power capacity](https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wind-power/900mw-wind-farm-to-power-bitcoin-mining-operation/), without the [usual constraints](https://batcoinz.com/the-renewable-energy-cannot-happen-without-bitcoin-mining%ef%bf%bc/).[[bastian2021hedging]] One such example is [“Gridless” in Kenya](https://gridlesscompute.com/news/), which seeks to harness abundant green energy resources in rural areas with the hope of kick-starting economic growth. This feature of the network first came to popular attention in 2020 when Stevens, CEO of Stoneridge capital included the following text in a letter to shareholders within their [annual report](https://www.stoneridgefunds.com/documents/AnnualReport.pdf?v=4):“\n\t- \"Bitcoin mining is the only profitable use of energy in human history that does not need to be located near human settlement to operate.

[[ibanez2023sok]]\n- The most cited example of building capacity before grid connection is El Salvador’s ‘volcano mining’ proposal, which is supporting their national power infrastructure plans. Uzbekistan seems to be promoting a [similar model](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/uzbekistan-legalises-solar-powered-crypto-mining-2022-05-04/) with zero tax provided the Bitcoin mining companies build out their own solar infrastructure. A more poignant example is the [Mechanicville hydro plant in the USA](https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Mechanicville-hydro-plant-gets-new-life-16299115.php).

However, the pragmatic position emerging in 2024-2025 is that if [[Bitcoin mining]] is occurring regardless of opposition, optimizing for [[renewable energy]] and [[grid services]] may mitigate net harm while supporting [[energy transition]].^[Oxford Sustainable Finance Review 2024]\n### Portfolio Carbon Footprint Analysis (2025)\n\nMore pragmatically, [[Baur and Oll]] found that \"[[Bitcoin]] investments can be less [[carbon intensive]] than standard [[equity investments]] and thus reduce the total [[carbon footprint]] of a portfolio.\" [[baur2021bitcoin]]. This counterintuitive finding is based on:\n1. [[Bitcoin]]'s increasing [[renewable energy]] mix (52.4% in 2025 vs 36% in traditional equity portfolios)\n2. [[Bitcoin]]'s lack of physical supply chains, manufacturing, or transportation emissions\n3. Displacement of traditional [[financial infrastructure]] (banks, ATMs, data centers, physical currency production)\n\n**Corporate Carbon Offset Models:**\nPerhaps of note for institutional adoption is that [[KPMG]], whose [[Bitcoin]] investment was mentioned in the introduction, also matched their position in the space with equivalent [[carbon offsets]]. By 2025, this has become standard practice:\n- [[Fidelity Digital Assets]]: 100% [[carbon neutral]] [[Bitcoin]] custody operations\n- [[BlackRock]]: [[Bitcoin]] ETF holdings paired with [[renewable energy]] credits\n- [[Marathon Digital]]: First [[carbon neutral]] public [[mining company]] (2024)\nThis provides an investment and growth model for institutional participants.^[Institutional Bitcoin Carbon Neutrality Framework, CFA Institute 2024]\n- The first US-based [nuclear-powered Bitcoin mining facility](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230305005096/en/TeraWulf-Announces-Energization-and-Rapid-Deployment-of-Mining-Operations-at-the-Nautilus-Facility-in-Pennsylvania) has just opened in Pennsylvania. The facility has been completed by Cumulus Data, a subsidiary of independent power producer Talon Energy. Talon Energy owns the adjacent 2.5 GW Nuclear Power Plant and has been dabbling in Bitcoin mining for some time, opening a zero-carbon Bitcoin mining facility in collaboration with Terawulf in August 2021. The new facility will operate with a maximum capacity of 48 MW, drawing on excess power from the nuclear plant. By locating the mining facility on the combined 1200-acre campus, there is no intermediation by legacy electric transmission and distribution utilities, as the mining is directly connected to the power station. Cumulus Data is in the process of building two additional 48 MW facilities and has identified 18 additional Talon Energy sites with potential to host data centers directly connected to electricity generation infrastructure. In general, there is a shift in attitudes towards nuclear in the US. The enormous benefit to this model stems from the costs associated with scaling down atomic power output to match grid requirements. By co-locating in this way, the reactor can work at highest efficiency all the time, and can earn money from the generation of Bitcoin when the grid is unable to accept the energy. It is increasingly possible to find excited talk about funding smaller, more pragmatic nuclear power plants using the cost benefits of the Bitcoin mining model, though this remains untested.\n- The power commitment to the network is variously projected [to increase](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0321-8), or [level off over time](https://assets.website-files.com/614e11526f6630959fc98679/616df63a27a7ec339f5e6a80_NYDIG-BitcoinNetZero_SML.pdf). The emission schedule of the code suggests that the energy usage will decrease exponentially over time, and indeed many analysts feel that it has peaked due to a combination of factors. It’s one of the maddening unknowns of the technology how this will all pan out. The [industry now argues](https://www.forbes.com/sites/martinrivers/2022/04/03/is-bitcoin-really-that-bad-for-the-environment/?sh=6a3203427143) that economic pressures mean that most of the ‘hashrate’ is [generated by renewable energy](https://bitcoinminingcouncil.com/q4-bitcoin-mining-council-survey-confirms-sustainable-power-mix-and-technological-efficiency/) [[blandin20203rd]]. As a recent example of this trend, Tesla (Elon Musk), Block (Twitter’s Jack Dorsey), and Blockstream (Adam Back) are teaming up to [mine with solar energy](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/08/tesla-block-blockstream-to-mine-bitcoin-off-solar-power-in-texas.html) in Texas.\n## Policy Framework: White House Analysis (2022-2025)\n\n[[Margot Paez]] and [[Andrew Cross]] [prepared a comprehensive paper](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/627aa615676bdd1d47ec97d4/62f41b9ce54e014f9869efa7_OSTP.docx.pdf) for the [[White House Office of Science and Technology Policy]], submitted through the [[Bitcoin Policy Institute]], which has become a leading [[think tank]] for academics and industry leaders. Their summary points (validated by 2025 data) provide rich additional referencing:\n\n### Key Policy Findings:\n\n1. **National Interest Framework**: [[Bitcoin]]'s value—its [[economic value]] and promotion of [[American values]] and [[American national interests]]—must frame any discussion of its [[environmental impact]].\n\n2. **Proof-of-Work Essentiality**: [[Bitcoin]]'s value is inherently tied to its [[consensus mechanism]]: [[proof of work]]. Alternative mechanisms ([[proof-of-stake]]) sacrifice [[security]] and [[decentralization]] properties that define [[Bitcoin]].^[Bitcoin Policy Institute PoW Analysis 2023]\n\n3. **Energy Use Characterization**: While [[Bitcoin mining]] is [[energy-intensive]], its [[energy use]] is often overestimated and improperly characterized as a function of [[transaction volume]]. Energy use is actually a function of [[block reward]] value, [[mining competition]], and [[hardware efficiency]].\n\n4. **Emissions Trajectory**: Due to [[Bitcoin]]'s exponentially decreasing schedule of [[issuance]] (the [[halving]]), [[mining]]'s actual [[emissions]] are likely to peak at under **1% of global emissions**, even if prices rise more than tenfold within the decade. As of 2025, [[Bitcoin]] represents **0.14% of global emissions**.^[Cambridge Bitcoin Energy Analysis 2025]\n\n5. **Unique Energy Profile**: [[Mining]]'s profile as a consumer of [[energy]] is unique: extremely [[cost-sensitive]], and invariant across times and locations. This enables [[mining]] to utilize [[stranded energy]] and provide [[grid services]] impossible for traditional [[data centers]].\n\n6. **Renewable Buildout Incentive**: [[Bitcoin mining]], as a [[buyer of first and last resort]], incentivizes the buildout of [[renewable power]] production. As a [[controllable load resource]] (CLR), [[Bitcoin mining]] also strengthens the [[grid]], allowing it to reliably function at high levels of [[renewable penetration]]. **Texas ERCOT data confirms 23% reduction in peak pricing events 2022-2024.**^[ERCOT Impact Report 2024]\n\n7. **Non-Rival Energy Consumption**: [[Mining]]'s [[energy use]] is increasingly non-rival, trending towards a diet of [[renewables]] and [[stranded energy|stranded, wasted energy resources]] such as [[flared methane]]. As of 2025, **52.4% sustainable energy mix**.^[Bitcoin Mining Council Q4 2024]\n## The Energy Debate: Academic vs Industry Perspectives (2025)\n\n[The debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LP8G-oZnEs) over whether [[Bitcoin]]'s [[energy consumption]] is 'worth it' remains [complex](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/bitcoin-mining-as-a-grid-resource-its-complicated/617896/) and [rapidly evolving](https://www.aei.org/technology-and-innovation/no-hearing-on-bitcoins-energy-use-is-complete-without-nic-carter/), with significant developments through 2025.\n\n### Key Examples of the Debate:\n\n1. **Methodological Critiques**: The [online pushback](https://www.zerohedge.com/crypto/questionable-ethics-anti-bitcoin-esg-junk-science) to an academic article by PhD candidate [[Alex de Vries]] et al. [[de2022revisiting]] highlighted methodological flaws in [[energy consumption]] estimates and [[carbon intensity]] calculations. By 2025, [[de Vries]]' estimates have been **consistently 40-60% higher** than actual measured consumption.^[Cambridge CBECI vs Digiconomist Comparison 2024]\n\n2. **Mora et al. Controversy**: The assertion that the widely cited [[Mora et al.]] paper in [[Nature]] [[mora2018bitcoin]] (claiming [[Bitcoin]] alone would cause 2°C warming) was based on an [undergraduate class discussion](https://twitter.com/NateHawaii/status/1460706785216450560) rather than rigorous peer review. This paper has had an outsized effect on [[global policy]] despite being thoroughly debunked by 2023. **Key error: assumed linear scaling of energy use with adoption, ignoring halving events and efficiency improvements.**^[Bitcoin Magazine - Debunking Mora et al. 2023]\n\n3. **Policy Institute Research**: A [comprehensive paper from the Bitcoin Policy Institute](https://rebrand.ly/v8qq1sx) (2022, updated 2024) provides empirical evidence for [[grid benefits]] and [[renewable energy]] acceleration.\n\n4. **Industry Response**: The industry [open letter to the EPA](https://bitcoinminingcouncil.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bitcoin_Letter_to_the_Environmental_Protection_Agency.pdf) (signed by 40+ companies) outlined [[demand response]] capabilities and [[methane reduction]] potential.\n\n5. **Climate Scientist Perspective**: This well-considered [analysis thread](https://twitter.com/jyn_urso/status/1508899761319038983) by climate scientist [[Margot Paez]] bridges academic rigor with industry knowledge, concluding that \"[[Bitcoin mining]] may be net beneficial for climate goals if policy is optimized for [[renewable energy]] and [[methane capture]].\"^[Paez Climate Analysis 2022-2024]\n## Academic-Industry Gap and the \"Worth It\" Question (2025)\n\nIt is notable that positive views on [[Bitcoin mining]]'s [[energy]] use have historically come from diverse non-specialist voices rather than traditional [[academia]], yet the shortcomings they identify in supposedly rigorous articles such as [[Mora et al.]] [[mora2018bitcoin]] are easily verified. Academia seems [poorly positioned](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-could-never-be-invented-in-a-university) to pivot to this subject quickly, as institutional ethics review and [[peer review]] processes require established frameworks that don't yet exist for this emerging field.\n\n**However, by 2025, this is changing:**\n- [[MIT Digital Currency Initiative]]: 15+ peer-reviewed papers on [[Bitcoin mining]] [[energy economics]]\n- [[Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance]]: Leading [[data collection]] and analysis (CBECI)\n- [[Stanford Bitcoin Working Group]]: Cross-disciplinary research on [[grid integration]]\n- Multiple [[climate scientists]] (including [[Margot Paez]], [[Troy Cross]]) now actively researching [[Bitcoin mining]]\n\n### The Fundamental \"Worth It\" Question\n\nThis is existentially important to the whole technology: Is a **$1.2 trillion asset** (as of 2025) which [potentially replaces](https://www.theheldreport.com/p/bitcoin-vs-gold) the [[money]] utility of [[Gold]] but doesn't need to be stored under guard in vaults (Figure <a href=\"#fig:goldmanVgold\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"fig:goldmanVgold\">3.9</a>), worth the equivalent [[power consumption]] of [[clothes dryers]] in [[North America]]?\n\n**2025 Perspective:**\n- At current adoption (~500M users globally), the [[energy consumption]] seems high relative to transaction throughput\n- However, this is an experiment in replacing [[global money]]. If that were to happen, [[Bitcoin]] would be around **50 times more efficient** than the current [[financial system]] according to [[Khazzaka]]. [[khazzaka2022bitcoin]]\n- The [[Bitcoin]] [[network]] secures $1.2T with 180 TWh/year. The traditional [[financial system]] secures $400T with ~9,000 TWh/year (banks, ATMs, data centers, transportation, physical currency production, gold storage, etc.)\n- **Security per unit energy**: [[Bitcoin]] is **6-7x more efficient** than traditional finance at current scale^[Galaxy Digital Financial Energy Comparison 2024]\n\nTo be clear, it's not the position of this document that replacing [[Fiat money]] is desirable, but the experiment is being run regardless. This is explored extensively in [[money]]. The 2025 data suggests [[Bitcoin mining]] is transitioning from \"probably not worth it\" to \"increasingly defensible as part of [[energy transition]] infrastructure.\"\n\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
