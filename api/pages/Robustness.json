(2025) for reinforcement learning agents in congestion management.\n- UK and North England examples:\n  - Manchester and Leeds have burgeoning AI research clusters focusing on robustness in autonomous systems and healthcare AI.\n  - Newcastle and Sheffield contribute through interdisciplinary projects combining AI robustness with cybersecurity and human-centred design.\n- Technical capabilities:\n  - Robust AI systems now routinely incorporate adversarial training, domain adaptation, and uncertainty quantification.\n  - Limitations remain in fully anticipating all real-world perturbations and in balancing robustness with model complexity and efficiency.\n- Standards and frameworks:\n  - OECD AI Principles (2019, updated 2024) promote robustness as part of trustworthy AI, emphasising human rights, fairness, and safety.\n  - Industry frameworks increasingly integrate robustness metrics alongside accuracy and fairness.\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers and sources:\n  - Tjhay, T., Bessa, R.
