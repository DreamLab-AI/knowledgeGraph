Publicly-shared cryptographic key within blockchain systems, providing essential functionality for distributed ledger technology operations and properties.\n\n  - Public key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography, is a foundational branch of cryptography that enables secure communication by using a pair of mathematically related keys: a public key for encryption and verification, and a private key for decryption and signing.\n\n\n  - ### Key Characteristics\n    id:: public-key-characteristics\n\n    - **Definitional Property**: Core component of asymmetric cryptography systems\n      - Public keys can be freely distributed without compromising security\n      - Mathematically linked to private keys through one-way trapdoor functions\n      - Based on computationally hard problems (factorization, discrete logarithms, elliptic curves)\n\n    - **Functional Property**: Operational behavior in cryptographic systems\n      - **Encryption**: Public keys encrypt data that only the corresponding private key can decrypt\n      - **Digital Signatures**: Public keys verify signatures created by private keys\n      - **Key Exchange**: Enables secure establishment of shared secrets over insecure channels\n      - **Authentication**: Proves identity without revealing private credentials\n\n    - **Structural Property**: Compositional elements\n      - Key Generation: Algorithms produce mathematically linked key pairs (RSA, ECC, DSA)\n      - Key Length: Typically 2048-4096 bits for RSA, 256-521 bits for ECC\n      - Key Format: Standardized formats (PEM, DER, SSH) for interoperability\n      - Certificate Binding: X.509 certificates bind public keys to identities\n\n    - **Security Property**: Security guarantees provided\n      - Computational Security: Based on difficulty of mathematical problems (no efficient factoring algorithm known)\n      - Forward Secrecy: Compromise of long-term keys doesn't compromise past sessions (when using ephemeral keys)\n      - Non-Repudiation: Digital signatures provide proof of origin that signer cannot deny\n      - Quantum Resistance: Post-quantum algorithms (lattice-based, hash-based) resist quantum attacks\n\n    - **Performance Property**: Efficiency considerations\n      - Asymmetric operations are 100-1000x slower than symmetric encryption\n      - Typically used for key exchange and signatures, not bulk data encryption\n      - Hybrid schemes combine asymmetric (key exchange) with symmetric (data encryption) for efficiency\n\n\n  - ### Technical Components\n    id:: public-key-components\n\n    - **Implementation**: How concept is realized technically\n      - **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)**: Based on difficulty of factoring large semi-primes\n        - Key sizes: 2048, 3072, 4096 bits\n        - Used for: Encryption, digital signatures, key exchange\n        - Performance: Slower, larger keys, widely supported\n      - **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)**: Based on discrete logarithm problem on elliptic curves\n        - Algorithms: ECDSA (signatures), ECDH (key exchange), EdDSA (Ed25519)\n        - Key sizes: 256, 384, 521 bits\n        - Used for: Digital signatures, key exchange, cryptocurrency addresses\n        - Performance: Faster, smaller keys, growing adoption\n      - **Post-Quantum Algorithms**: Designed to resist quantum computer attacks\n        - Lattice-based: NTRU, CRYSTALS-Kyber (NIST selected for encryption)\n        - Hash-based: SPHINCS+ (NIST selected for signatures)\n        - Code-based: Classic McEliece\n\n    - **Verification**: Methods for validating correctness\n      - **Certificate Authorities (CAs)**: Trusted third parties that sign and validate public keys\n      - **Web of Trust**: Decentralized trust model (PGP) where users sign each other's keys\n      - **Certificate Transparency**: Public logs of all issued certificates for monitoring\n      - **Key Pinning**: Applications specify expected public keys to prevent MITM attacks\n      - **Blockchain-based**: Public keys stored on immutable ledgers for verification\n\n    - **Interaction**: Relationships with other components\n      - **PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)**: Framework of policies, hardware, software, and procedures for managing public keys\n        - Components: Certificate Authorities, Registration Authorities, Certificate Repositories, Revocation Lists (CRL/OCSP)\n      - **TLS/SSL**: Uses public key cryptography for server authentication and session key establishment\n      - **Blockchain**: Public keys serve as addresses; private keys authorize transactions\n      - **SSH**: Public key authentication for secure remote access\n      - **S/MIME and PGP**: Email encryption and signing using public key pairs\n      - **Code Signing**: Developers sign software with private keys; users verify with public keys\n\n    - **Constraints**: Technical limitations and requirements\n      - **Key Management**: Secure generation, storage, distribution, rotation, and revocation of keys\n      - **Quantum Threat**: Shor's algorithm can break RSA/ECC on sufficiently powerful quantum computers\n      - **Performance Overhead**: Asymmetric operations require significantly more computation than symmetric\n      - **Key Size Trade-offs**: Larger keys provide more security but slower performance\n      - **Implementation Vulnerabilities**: Side-channel attacks, timing attacks, padding oracle attacks\n      - **Trust Dependencies**: Security relies on trustworthiness of CAs or trust establishment mechanisms\n\n\n  - ### Use Cases\n    id:: public-key-use-cases\n\n    - **1. Secure Web Communication (HTTPS/TLS)**\n      - **Application**: Encrypted and authenticated connections between browsers and web servers\n      - **Example**: When accessing `https://example.com`, the server's public key certificate is verified and used to establish an encrypted session\n      - **Requirements**: X.509 certificates, trusted Certificate Authority, modern cipher suites\n      - **Benefits**: Protects data in transit, authenticates server identity, enables e-commerce and online banking\n\n    - **2.
