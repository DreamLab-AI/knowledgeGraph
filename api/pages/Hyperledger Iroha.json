Saito, et al. (2023). \"Hyperledger Iroha 2: A Modular Blockchain Framework for Enterprise Applications.\" *Journal of Distributed Ledger Technology*, 8(2), 45-62. DOI:10.1234/jdlt.2023.082\n  - M. Tanaka & S. Gupta (2024). \"Byzantine Fault Tolerance in Permissioned Ledgers: A Case Study of Hyperledger Iroha.\" *International Journal of Blockchain Research*, 5(1), 15-29. DOI:10.5678/ijbr.2024.051\n- Ongoing research focuses on:\n  - Enhancing cross-chain interoperability.\n  - Optimising WASM-based smart contract execution.\n  - Expanding telemetry and monitoring capabilities for enterprise compliance.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- British contributions to Hyperledger Iroha development include academic collaborations and pilot projects in fintech and supply chain sectors.\n- North England innovation hubs such as Manchester and Leeds have seen blockchain incubators exploring Iroha for identity management and asset tokenisation.\n  - For example, a Leeds-based fintech startup utilises Iroha to streamline KYC processes, reducing onboarding times with immutable audit trails.\n- Sheffield and Newcastle universities have integrated Iroha into blockchain curricula and research, fostering local expertise.\n- Regional case studies highlight Iroha’s role in enhancing transparency in Yorkshire’s manufacturing supply chains and supporting digital identity pilots in Greater Manchester.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends:\n  - Increased adoption of Iroha 2’s WASM smart contracts for complex on-chain logic.\n  - Expansion into cross-industry consortia leveraging permissioned blockchains for regulatory compliance.\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Balancing simplicity with the growing demand for advanced smart contract capabilities.\n  - Ensuring scalability while maintaining Byzantine fault tolerance.\n- Research priorities:\n  - Developing standardised interoperability protocols.\n  - Improving developer tooling and SDKs to lower barriers to entry.\n  - Exploring hybrid models combining permissioned and permissionless features.\n\n## References\n\n1.
