It can be seen that the description is somewhat in the eye of the beholder.\n  It's possible to frame this Ethereum Web3 as a hugely complex and inefficient digital rights management system (DRM). DRM is something that users of the internet are increasingly familiar and comfortable with. It's somewhat debatable whether decentralising this is worthwhile. The thesis of the developers of the technology seems to be that without it, control of 'value' will accrete over time, to one or more hegemonic controlling entities. It's a strong argument, but there is a [substantial counter argument](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html) emerging that users just don't want this stuff. The nervousness of legislators in the USA to the attempt by Facebook/Meta to enter this peer-to-peer value transmission space is telling in terms of the perception of who is driving Web3.\n  Throughout 2022 there was much furore on the internet over what Web3 might be, and who it 'serves'. Enthusiasts feel that products such as [Sign-In with Ethereum](https://blog.spruceid.com/sign-in-with-ethereum-is-a-game-changer-part-1/) (EIP-4361) might give users choice over their data sovereignty, and a meme to this effect is seen in Figure [2.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch2.F3 \"Figure 2.3 ‣ 2.3.1 Emerging consensus ‣ 2.3 Web3 ‣ Chapter 2 Decentralisation & The Web ‣ Part I State of the art\"). In practice though users are expecting to use badly written, buggy, economically vulnerable 'crypto' wallets to log into websites. The quality of this wallet software is improving of late with the so called \"wallet wars\" seeing commerce grade offerings from Coinbase and shares platform 'Robinhood'. These two companies alone have over 100 million users. It's likely that these wallets will evolve to offer the full spectrum of Web3 functionality. With that said it doesn't seem to make much sense yet on the face of it. There are in fact examples of the technology completely failing at censorship resistance.

The important takeaway here is not so much this oft quoted elevator pitch for Web3, but the fact that legislative bodies now consider this technology a force which they need to be aware of and [potentially contend with](https://a16z.com/2021/12/17/prediction-for-the-new-year-a-web3-midterm/).\n  Jeremy Allaire, again of Circle', talks about the recent legislative order in the USA as follows: [\"this is a watershed moment for crypto, digital assets, and Web 3, akin to the 1996/1997 whole of government wakeup to the commercial internet.

Users of UK exchanges must provide a great deal of personal financial information, and undertake to prove that the wallets they are withdrawing to are their own. From the perspective of the UK SME it seems this seriously limits the potential audience for new products. Europe meanwhile has recently voted through even more restrictive regulation, applying the \"[transfer of funds regulation](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-an-economy-that-works-for-people/file-revision-of-the-regulation-on-transfers-of-funds)\" to all transactions coming out of exchanges, enforcing a database of all addresses between companies, and reporting transactions above 1000 Euros to authorities. They have narrowly avoided enforcing KYC on all transfers to private wallets, but have capped transactions at 1000 Euros. The recent [\"Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA)](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/06/30/digital-finance-agreement-reached-on-european-crypto-assets-regulation-mica/) legislation imposes overheads that may make it harder for smaller businesses in the sector to operate within the EU, but is has been cautiously welcomed by established players (Figure [2.5](https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch2.F5 \"Figure 2.5 ‣ 2.3.1 Emerging consensus ‣ 2.3 Web3 ‣ Chapter 2 Decentralisation & The Web ‣ Part I State of the art\"), who have been hungry for clarity.
