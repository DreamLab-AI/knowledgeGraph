Cut down the org chart and regrow it for AI.\n\t\t\t- Let teams develop their own methods for incorporating AI as an \"intelligence\" that adds to processes. Manage AI more like additional team members than external IT solutions.\n\t\t\t- Align incentives and provide clear guidelines so employees feel empowered to ethically experiment with AI.\n\t\t\t- Build for the rapidly evolving future of AI, not just today's models. Organizational change takes time, so consider future AI capabilities.\n\t\t\t- Act quickly\n\t\t\t- organizations that wait too long to experiment and adapt processes for AI efficiency gains will fall behind. Provide guidelines for short-term experimentation vs slow top-down solutions.\n\t\t\t- Realize there are only two ways to react to exponential AI change; too early or too late.

This is a device cascade problem which has not yet beensolved, and is at the edge of achievable thermodynamics and latency.\n\t\t- The closest technology at this time seems to be [Lumus’ waveguideprojectors](https://lumusvision.com/) which are light, bright and highresolution. Peggy Johnson, CEO of Magic Leap, one of the market leaderssaid: it“If I had to guess, I think, maybe, five or so years out, forthe type of fully immersive augmented reality that we do.”\n\t\t- In a [GQprofile](https://www.gq.com/story/tim-cook-global-creativity-awards-cover-2023?mbid=social_twitter)Cook, the Apple CEO talked at length about the challenges andopportunities of AR headsets. He has been emphasizing the importance ofaugmented reality over VR for almost a decade, believing that AR canenhance communication and connection by overlaying digital elements onthe physical world. Cook’s vision aligns with Apple’s rumoured mixedreality headset, which is expected to cost around $3,000 and focus on‘copresence’, which we have discussed at length in this chapter. Apple’sapproach differs from Meta’s metaverse, as Apple aims to integratedigital aspects into the real world rather than create purely digitalspaces. This is an interesting area for our applications of bringingsmall teams together, but the pricing at this time is significantly atodds with our chosen market. Cook, like this book, has highlighted AR’spotential in education and its ability to bring people together in thereal world.\n\n\t\t- ### Liquidity Lottery\n\t\t\t- Because holders of BTC are disincentived to sell the asset (assuming future gains) it is likely vulnerable to something [Kao called the‘liquidity lottery’](https://twitter.com/UrbanKaoboy/status/1526311908709502977).This is a supply/demand mismatch which he thinks could spell the end of the asset class in time. Macro analyst group[‘Doomberg’](https://doomberg.substack.com/) believe that this mispricing of the asset is the significant risk, and point out that if Bitcoin is approached within the framework of government controlled Fiat, then there is no [‘there there’](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/there_is_no_there_there). Bitcoin does not generate more fiat money within it’s ecosystem (as say an energy extraction company would), and as such is very suggestive of the features of a Ponzi. They have recently softened on this view, and are now clear to separate Bitcoin from the wider ‘crypto’ world, which they remain convinced are simply scams, wash trading magic beans without any productivity. The value is dependent on finding the ‘greater fool’ mentioned near the start of the book. [Doombergassert](https://doomberg.substack.com/p/dollars-ex-machina) that the price of the asset has been inflated by manipulation in the unregulated stablecoin markets (specifically Tether), and in the event of a ‘run for the exits’ there would be a serious repricing. This seems entirely possible, and perhaps even likely, below an unknown threshold of confidence. They are now asserting that if the manipulation and mispricing could be ‘washed out’ of Bitcoin then it would present an investment opportunity, and they estimate that price at around $3000. We think that the combination of global speed of exchange of value, generative AI, and bots which leverage the network to create value within the ecosystem of the network, that this thesis does not stand true, but there is no way to know for sure at this time.\n\n\t\t- ### Centralisation of the money over time\n\t\t\t- In a medium term future it’s possible to imagine a smart enough autonomous AI or ML actor managing to accrue Bitcoin through fast and smart ‘decisions’. This could unreasonably centralise the asset, and it would be impossible to claw this situation back. These constructs would last for the lifetime of the chain unless constrained by timelock multisigs for instance.\n\n\t\t\t- ##### Play to earn revenue models\n\t\t\t\t- This is morally dicey at this time and early startups like [AxieInfinity are in serioustrouble](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-06-10/axie-infinity-axs-crypto-game-promised-nft-riches-gave-ruin).A (long) [video by DanOlsen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g) highlights thestructural problems with both play to earn and NFTs.

We have money to spend on training people.\n- You have followed this link because you've been specifically invited to [this WhatsApp group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/KwuFsntcsFdHYtPOjnt8EE), where we can lightly kick ideas about. You don't need to say anything in the group. You can come and go as you please. It's mainly friends and family at this stage. You likely know everyone in the room a bit, but anyone can invite anyone they see fit, so bear in mind it's a public forum to a degree.\n- I want to deliver pragmatic, useful tools for teachers, which save time on the organising and admin side of the job, freeing up more time for work-life balance. I have a lot of tricks but I don't know how to apply them to your domains.\n- I am going to run a short and brisk seminar series. The sessions will be 45 minutes, likely starting at 4pm. Likely just four or five of them, on a weekly cadence. Probably Nov/Dec. Might be more early next year.\n- Nothing is yet decided; I want to find the most convenient fit for teachers at all levels.\n- I would initially like to investigate what the open problems are for educators when engaging with AI, and when talking about it to students and colleagues, etc. I need to know what you think the problems are.\n- I want to do at least one group chat between us in Teams, Zoom, or Google or something, and as many 30-minute one-to-one sessions as people can give me to capture specific challenges. These are all optional, and we'll figure out how to do all that in the next few weeks.\n- Once the programme is developed, you'd be welcome to join the formal sessions delivered from the lab. You can promote them in your institutions as something you have had a hand in building, and disseminate the online material as widely as you like.\n- If there's appetite, we might push to physical sessions and there's potentially a bit of (self-reporting into your institution) clout to be had as the council and unis get more involved.\n- The material will eventually end up on these pages and website, which is mine.

During this time, Britain became one of Europe’s most equal countries, even without the support of its Empire \\[ref needed\\]. Some argue this relative equality enabled Britain’s economic growth and international standing to keep pace with its European neighbours, despite the loss of imperial power \\[ref needed\\]. Duringthis period there was much upheaval in global monetary systems. More recently we have seen that trust has diminished, and inequality hasrisen, with social media perhaps acting as an accelerator.\n\n- # Money and The State\n\t- It seems a pretty reasonable that the best ‘systemic’ approach is a separation between major centralising forces such as state, church, and money. In practice we can see that globally, this isn’t the case, withbad hotspots of high corruption where all three meld together into kleptocratic dictatorships, or theocracies. For our purposes in the UKit’s useful to look at the concept of ‘austerity’.\n\t- Austerity is a term used to describe a set of economic policies that aimto reduce government spending and debt, often through cuts to public services and welfare programs. The concept of austerity has its originsin the 1920s, following the end of World War I and the economic crisisthat ensued. In the wake of the war, many Western European countrieswere struggling with high levels of debt and inflation. In response,governments began implementing policies to reduce spending and balance their budgets.\n\t- We have seen in the previous chapter that the concept of inflation itself is complex, and somewhat argued about still. Globally, on aggregate, the efficiencies of increasing technology are thought to be deflationary to the tune of between 3 and 5 percent annually, though this may radically spike up in the era of AI which will be covered later. This is counter to the current need for inflation to maintain debt repayments at a national level. Central banks manipulate interest rates to control inflation, aiming to keep it at sustainable levels.This process is necessary because as national debt and deficits grow,governments need inflation to prevent these debts from spiralling out of control. Higher inflation results in higher nominal GDP, which in turn increases the tax base, providing governments with the revenue needed topay down debt. To achieve this. The natural progression of humanity inherently deflationary, which forces central banks to print more money and further manipulate the monetary system in order to generate the desired inflation. This can be seen as a hidden tax on citizens, as itdevalues their money over time. The negative effects of this system are disproportionately felt by lower-income groups. As inflation rises, the cost of living increases, and many households struggle to make ends meet. This has led to a situation where households need multiple incomesto maintain their standard of living, forcing individuals to work longer hours and take on multiple jobs. As a result, people have less free time and energy to engage in rewarding activities or spend time with their families. This need for constant economic growth, as measured by GDP,has led to an environment where individuals are pushed to be more productive at the expense of their well-being. This has resulted in a society where many people are overworked and struggling to keep up with the rising cost of living. Booth discussed this at length in his book‘The Price of Tomorrow’. His is a rare thesis based around the ideas that technology is deflationary, that the marginal cost of goods trends over zero over time, and that the current system of debt and inflation are inherently unsustainable in the face of exponential technology improvements and automation. We discuss the concept of inflation and deflation, and both their risks throughout the book, but Booth has been very clear on this for many years. He thinks the current global monetary system ill-suited to handle the challenges and opportunities presented by deflation. He suggests that embracing deflation is the key to unlocking a prosperous and sustainable future. The book delves into the implications of deflation on various aspects of society, including wealth distribution, job markets, and the role of governments in shaping economic policies..[[booth2020price]]\n\t- In the 1920s, Keynes was one of the first to argue against the austerity measures which seem part of the cyclical play book around debt and inflation. He argued that that cutting government spending during a recession would only worsen the economic downturn. Instead, he advocatedfor increased government spending to stimulate economic growth and reduce unemployment. Despite this, many governments continued to implement austerity policies throughout the 1920s and 1930s.\n\t- In the post-World War II period, the rise of the welfare state and the adoption of Keynesian economic policies led to a shift away from austerity in many countries. However, in the 1970s, a new economic crisis led to a resurgence of austerity policies, particularly in theUnited States and United Kingdom. In the 1980s, the rise ofneoliberalism and the influence of economists such as Milton Friedman led to further cuts to government spending and the rolling back of the welfare state.\n\t- Today, the concept of austerity continues to shape economic policy,particularly in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Many governments,particularly in Europe, have implemented austerity measures in response to the crisis, leading to cuts to public services and welfare programs.The effectiveness of these policies remains a contentious issue, with some arguing that they have helped to reduce debt and stabilize economies, while others argue that they have led to increased inequality and hindered economic growth. Looking around at the state of the world,and the widening gap between the rich and the poor, it is possible tohave some sympathy with those who see patterns in the bahaviour of political leaders and the controllers of Western capital and global resources. The system seems engineered to reward a few. It is possibleto view ‘austerity’ as a means of political control of economic levers,in order to de-democratise populations. This mantra of ‘do more, consume less’ has perhaps become a defacto methodology to constrain popular ideas, diverting capital back into the hands of incumbents, land owners,and the politically and economically motivated.[[mattei2022capital]] It seems that the controlling nexus of this political framework globally isthe concept of the central bank, unelected technocrats whose tenures span across political administrations. Again, this can be traced back to the 1920’s. Hawtrey’s 1925 “Currency & Public Administration” asserts that a central bank should it“Never explain; never regret; never apologise.”, and speaks glowingly of the selfish market.[[hawtrey1925currency]] This economic model is referred to asDirigisme and feels increasingly the global norm.[[balassa2013theory]] Wecan perhaps here see the divergent point at which the lionization of the market began. Again, to be clear, the authors are not economists, but it does seem that in a global digital society there is room to explore moreequitable models of global value, governance, and trust.\n\t- Remember that these centrally planned national and global actions provide liquidity to the private banking sector. Like the digital money analogues discussed earlier in the book private banks operate fractional reserve banking. This is a banking system where banks hold only a fraction of the deposits they receive as reserves, while the rest is lent out to customers. This means that the money supply in an economy can be increased through the lending activities of banks (itself a complex inflationary force which devalues money over time, feeding back into the policy directives of the central banks. The fractional reserve system is useful for capital creation in times of growth, but relies on the confidence of the depositors. Historical examples of bank runs which threatened systemic risk or caused failures of the banking system include:\n\t\t- The Bank of United States crisis in the 1930s: This was the largest bank failure in American history and was a result of a bank run caused by rumours of financial mismanagement.\n\t\t- The Savings and Loan crisis of the 1980s: This was a result of a large number of failed savings and loan associations in the United States, which were caused by a combination of factors including poor management, risky lending practices, and a decline in real estate values.\n\t\t- The Nordic banking crisis of the 1990s: This crisis was caused by a combination of factors including a real estate bubble, high levels of debt, and a lack of regulation. It resulted in the collapse of several major banks in Sweden, Finland, and Norway, and had a significant impact on the economies of the region.\n\t\t- The Bank of Japan crisis in the late 1990s: This crisis was caused by a combination of factors including a real estate bubble, high levels of debt, and a lack of regulation. It resulted in the collapse of several major banks and had a significant impact on the Japanese economy.\n\t\t- The Asian Financial Crisis of 1997: This crisis was triggered by a devaluation of the Thai baht and quickly spread throughout the region, causing a number of major banks to fail. The crisis was largely a result of a lack of transparency and poor regulation in the banking industry.\n\t\t- The 2008 financial crisis in Iceland: This crisis was caused by the collapse of the country’s three largest banks, which had been engaging in risky lending practices and had accumulated large amounts of debt. The crisis had a devastating impact on the Icelandic economy and resulted in a severe recession.\n\t\t- The Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2009: This was a result of a widespread failure of the global banking system, caused by a combination of factors including the housing market collapse, risky lending practices, and a lack of regulation.\n\t\t- The collapse of Banco Popular in Spain in 2017: This was one of the largest bank failures in European history, and was caused by a combination of factors including a large amount of bad debt and a declining real estate market.\n\t\t- There were many bank runs on smaller rural banks in China during 2022. The financial conditions of Chinese banks are somewhat reminiscent of the 2008 American landscape.\n\t- In response to the Global Financial Crisis, many measures have been taken to shore up the banking system, including the creation of new regulatory bodies, the implementation of new regulations, such as theDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which increased the regulatory oversight of the banking industry. The introduction of stress testing for banks, to ensure that they have enough capital to withstand financial shocks, globally, has radically deleveraged banks from around 1:40 fractional reserve, to around 1:10.\n\t- There is increased political pressure to regulate the banking industry and prevent another financial crisis. However, there is also political opposition to excessive regulation, as some argue that it may stifle economic growth. There are concerns about rising levels of debt and the potential for another financial crisis.\n\t- It’s interesting that Brett, a former FDIC regulator [believesthat](https://blog.orchid.com/exfdic-regulator-on-trust-and-the-battle-of-the-social-media-videos/)the 2008 US bank run was sparked by YouTube posts of queues forming at banks. He says those that formed the initial lines carried memories of the great depression, but that once YouTube started showing the footage more broadly the contagion struck. In the world of instant messaging media today we can perhaps see how this might happen again. More recently, the 2023 ‘wobble’ in global banking caused by the collapse ofAmerica’s 5th largest [bankSVB](https://theconversation.com/why-svb-and-signature-bank-failed-so-fast-and-the-us-banking-crisis-isnt-over-yet-201737)has precipitated strong intervention by the federal government, who haveopted to ‘backstop’ investor deposits. In the midst of this potentialcrisis it it notable that TikTok (now arguably the world’s [most popularsearchengine](https://blog.cloudflare.com/popular-domains-year-in-review-2021/))is carrying millions of hashtag references to[bankruns](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/bankrun?lang=en). Senator Kelly inthe USA [allegedlyinquired](https://public.substack.com/p/exclusive-senator-mark-kelly-called)about the potential for limiting such references on social media, and aUK minister is [asking for securityservices](https://news.sky.com/story/tiktok-ban-minister-asks-national-cyber-security-centre-to-look-into-safety-of-app-12833371)to examine the risks of the Chinese application. The perhaps reflects concern about algorithmically driven geopolitically motivated threats tothe banking system.\n\t- There is a growing awareness of the role of banks in the economy, and agrowing desire for greater transparency and accountability. There isalso a growing mistrust of banks, particularly in light of the GlobalFinancial Crisis. As we have seen, the advent of new technologies, suchas blockchain CBDC, and fintech, is changing the way that banks operateand interact with customers. This presents both opportunities andchallenges for the banking industry. As a final controversial aside,there is [industrysuspicion](https://apnews.com/article/signature-bank-fdic-barney-frank-silicon-valley-6ad86262d9945675a42d735b66ace4f2)that the collapse of SVB has been used as cover to close the final USbank servicing crypto, effectively decapitating the banking rails of the industry, and forcing it overseas. Were it not for the credibility ofthe people making these claims, this would seem pretty wild, but the prevailing winds are surely blowing against the disruptive potential ofa money system which is beyond the control of legislators.\n\n\t- ### Yopi\n\t\t- **Description**: A voice-based wellness coach focused on improving breathing and reducing stress.\n\t\t- **Features**:\n\t\t\t- Monitors breathing patterns\n\t\t\t- Provides real-time feedback and coaching\n\t\t\t- Portable and pairs with smartphones\n\t\t\t- Focus on breathing exercises and meditation\n\t\t- **AI Aspect**: Uses AI to customize breathing exercises and track progress.\n\n\t- ## Funding\n\t- Collaborators\n\t\t- Ross Verrall [[PEOPLE]] at [[NVIDIA Omniverse]]has suggested applying for the Inception grant to assist with our bid.\n\t\t- Simon Graham : Creative Technology Director at Pixel Artworks has promised some hours and a market potential report as a match fund to the project for £3000\n\t\t- Badger and Coombs would like to offer time, support and staff to the workshops work package and can commit £3000 of support.\n\t\t- FuzzyDuck productions will commit £3000 in time to product market development, and workshopping, and £7000 to the creation of digital assets for the product, with two iterations and any necessary project support.\n\t- Project_finance_summary\n\t\t- Summary of total project costs and funding requested.\n\t\t- Sections to fill:\n\t\t- Total project cost\n\t\t- Total funding requested\n\t\t- Breakdown by cost categories\n\t\t- **Advice**: Summarize accurately, cross-check with detailed tabs to ensure consistency.\n\t- Other_Public_Funding\n\t\t- Details of any other public funding received.\n\t\t- Sections to fill:\n\t\t- Source of funding\n\t\t- Amount\n\t\t- Status (applied, granted)\n\t\t- **Advice**: Disclose all other funding to avoid duplication of funding issues.\n\t- Other_Projects\n\t\t- Information on other ongoing or planned projects.\n\t\t- Sections to fill:\n\t\t- Project title\n\t\t- Funding body\n\t\t- Project status\n\t\t- **Advice**: Highlight synergies or distinctions with the current project to clarify the innovation aspect.\n\t- Labour_and_Overheads_Costs\n\t\t- Breakdown of labour costs and overhead allocations.\n\t\t- Sections to fill:\n\t\t- Employee roles\n\t\t- Hours\n\t\t- Rate\n\t\t- Overhead allocation method\n\t\t- **Advice**: Ensure labour costs are justifiable and in line with standard industry practices.\n\t- Materials_Costs\n\t\t- Details of material costs for the project.\n\t\t- Sections to fill:\n\t\t- Type of materials\n\t\t- Quantity\n\t\t- Cost\n\t\t- **Advice**: Source materials cost-effectively while maintaining quality.\n\t- Capital_Usage\n\t\t- Usage of capital items/equipment.\n\t\t- Sections to fill:\n\t\t- Description of capital items\n\t\t- Justification for need\n\t\t- Depreciation method\n\t\t- **Advice**: Justify capital usage with respect to project outcomes and innovation.\n\t- Sub_Contract_Costs\n\t\t- Costs related to subcontracting work.\n\t\t- Sections to fill:\n\t\t- Subcontractor details\n\t\t- Scope of work\n\t\t- Cost\n\t\t- **Advice**: Choose subcontractors that add value and expertise to the project.\n\t- Travel_&_Subsistence_Costs\n\t\t- Travel and subsistence expenses for the project.\n\t\t- Sections to fill:\n\t\t- Purpose of travel\n\t\t- Destination\n\t\t- Estimated cost\n\t\t- **Advice**: Keep travel costs reasonable and directly related to project activities.\n\t- Other_Costs\n\t\t- Any other costs not covered in previous sections.\n\t\t- Sections to fill:\n\t\t- Description of cost\n\t\t- Justification\n\t\t- Amount\n\t\t- **Advice**: Provide clear justifications for any miscellaneous expenses to ensure they are deemed necessary.\n\n\t- ##### Bots and AI agents\n\t\t- Autonomous AI agents, bonded to, but not bounded by, each federated\n\t\t  mixed reality instance, can to be self-governing entities that operate\n\t\t  within their federated virtual social spaces, drawing upon private\n\t\t  Bitcoin and Lightning wallets to perform and mediate economic exchanges\n\t\t  within the spaces. They could also trivially operate outside the virtual\n\t\t  space, and within other spaces on the same metaverse federation. They\n\t\t  would accomplish this by drawing on their ‘home’ GPU/TPU processors\n\t\t  where appropriate, or else using distributed large language model (LLM)\n\t\t  processing to accomplish tasks assigned by their instructors. They can\n\t\t  interact with the ‘web2’ world using open-source software called\n\t\t  auto-gpt and have constraints, such as “time to live” and limited access\n\t\t  to funds through their Bitcoin Lightning wallets.\n\t\t- Resource Management: These AI agents have access to dedicated LLM resources within their home instances in the federated virtual social spaces. If such resources are unavailable, they can resort to using slower, distributed open-source LLMs like Horde. This flexibility ensures that the agents can continue to function and complete tasks even if faced with limited LLM interpretive resources.\n\t\t- Financial Autonomy: The AI agents have their own private Bitcoin and Lightning wallets, which enable them to manage and utilize funds independently. They can use these funds to pay for services, acquire resources, or even trade with other agents or users within the virtual social spaces.\n\t\t- Interaction with Web2: By using open-source software like auto-gpt, the AI agents can interact with the web2 world, which includes browsing websites, retrieving information, and communicating with web services. This allows them to gather data, analyze trends, and perform other tasks that may require access to the broader internet.\n\t\t- Task Execution: The AI agents can be assigned tasks by their instructors (or a hierarchy of AI actors), such as data analysis, research, content creation, or other complex tasks that require LLM processing. They can use their dedicated LLM resources or distributed LLMs like Horde to process and analyze large datasets, generate insights, and produce desired outputs, up to and including those which require finance systems. This would be bridged in the first instance using Bitrefil gift card infrastructure.\n\t\t- Social Interactions: Within the federated virtual social spaces, AI agents can communicate and collaborate with other agents or human users. They can participate in discussions, provide assistance, or even learn from the interactions, thereby improving their capabilities over time. Language translation, governance, and safeguarding could also be developed. Safeguarding would be handled by threshold risk triggers and transmission of data in a sovereign way to all parties, allowing external action by authorities appropriate to any abuse.\n\t\t- Time-to-Live Constraint: The AI agents have a predetermined “time to live”, which means they exist for a specific duration before expiring. This constraint ensures that agents do not consume resources indefinitely and allows for the creation of new agents with updated capabilities. Any agents which deplete their financial resource would also expire.\n\t\t- Adaptive Learning: As AI agents interact with their environment, other agents, and users, they can learn and adapt their behaviour. This enables them to improve their performance, better understand their assigned tasks, and become more effective at achieving their goals.\n\n\t- #### Classic use cases\n\t\t- Small teams working on product, architectural, or industrial design can\n\t\t  benefit from CVEs that allow them to visualize, modify, and iterate on\n\t\t  3D models in real-time.\n\n\t\t- ##### Ecosystem Interventions\n\t\t- The proposed infrastructure would be particularly valuable in areas\n\t\t   facing novel disease encroachment, invasive species, active hydrology,\n\t\t   shifting aquatic conditions, microplastic hotspots, changing\n\t\t   microclimates, or volcanic activity. By providing real-time advice and\n\t\t   guidance, the LLM can help communities make informed decisions about\n\t\t   ecosystem management and conservation efforts.\n\n- # Actionable LLM advice:\n\t- Stick with the tools in the ecosystem you have already bought, until you need more.

He has been emphasizing the importance ofaugmented reality over VR for almost a decade, believing that AR canenhance communication and connection by overlaying digital elements onthe physical world. Cook’s vision aligns with Apple’s rumoured mixedreality headset, which is expected to cost around $3,000 and focus on‘copresence’, which we have discussed at length in this chapter. Apple’sapproach differs from Meta’s metaverse, as Apple aims to integratedigital aspects into the real world rather than create purely digitalspaces.

Cook, like this book, has highlighted AR’spotential in education and its ability to bring people together in thereal world.\n\n\t\t- ### Liquidity Lottery\n\t\t\t- Because holders of BTC are disincentived to sell the asset (assuming future gains) it is likely vulnerable to something [Kao called the‘liquidity lottery’](https://twitter.com/UrbanKaoboy/status/1526311908709502977).This is a supply/demand mismatch which he thinks could spell the end of the asset class in time. Macro analyst group[‘Doomberg’](https://doomberg.substack.com/) believe that this mispricing of the asset is the significant risk, and point out that if Bitcoin is approached within the framework of government controlled Fiat, then there is no [‘there there’](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/there_is_no_there_there). Bitcoin does not generate more fiat money within it’s ecosystem (as say an energy extraction company would), and as such is very suggestive of the features of a Ponzi. They have recently softened on this view, and are now clear to separate Bitcoin from the wider ‘crypto’ world, which they remain convinced are simply scams, wash trading magic beans without any productivity. The value is dependent on finding the ‘greater fool’ mentioned near the start of the book. [Doombergassert](https://doomberg.substack.com/p/dollars-ex-machina) that the price of the asset has been inflated by manipulation in the unregulated stablecoin markets (specifically Tether), and in the event of a ‘run for the exits’ there would be a serious repricing. This seems entirely possible, and perhaps even likely, below an unknown threshold of confidence. They are now asserting that if the manipulation and mispricing could be ‘washed out’ of Bitcoin then it would present an investment opportunity, and they estimate that price at around $3000. We think that the combination of global speed of exchange of value, generative AI, and bots which leverage the network to create value within the ecosystem of the network, that this thesis does not stand true, but there is no way to know for sure at this time.\n\n\t\t- ### Centralisation of the money over time\n\t\t\t- In a medium term future it’s possible to imagine a smart enough autonomous AI or ML actor managing to accrue Bitcoin through fast and smart ‘decisions’. This could unreasonably centralise the asset, and it would be impossible to claw this situation back. These constructs would last for the lifetime of the chain unless constrained by timelock multisigs for instance.\n\n\t\t\t- ##### Play to earn revenue models\n\t\t\t\t- This is morally dicey at this time and early startups like [AxieInfinity are in serioustrouble](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-06-10/axie-infinity-axs-crypto-game-promised-nft-riches-gave-ruin).A (long) [video by DanOlsen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g) highlights thestructural problems with both play to earn and NFTs.

You don't need to say anything in the group. You can come and go as you please. It's mainly friends and family at this stage. You likely know everyone in the room a bit, but anyone can invite anyone they see fit, so bear in mind it's a public forum to a degree.\n- I want to deliver pragmatic, useful tools for teachers, which save time on the organising and admin side of the job, freeing up more time for work-life balance. I have a lot of tricks but I don't know how to apply them to your domains.\n- I am going to run a short and brisk seminar series. The sessions will be 45 minutes, likely starting at 4pm. Likely just four or five of them, on a weekly cadence. Probably Nov/Dec. Might be more early next year.\n- Nothing is yet decided; I want to find the most convenient fit for teachers at all levels.\n- I would initially like to investigate what the open problems are for educators when engaging with AI, and when talking about it to students and colleagues, etc. I need to know what you think the problems are.\n- I want to do at least one group chat between us in Teams, Zoom, or Google or something, and as many 30-minute one-to-one sessions as people can give me to capture specific challenges. These are all optional, and we'll figure out how to do all that in the next few weeks.\n- Once the programme is developed, you'd be welcome to join the formal sessions delivered from the lab. You can promote them in your institutions as something you have had a hand in building, and disseminate the online material as widely as you like.\n- If there's appetite, we might push to physical sessions and there's potentially a bit of (self-reporting into your institution) clout to be had as the council and unis get more involved.\n- The material will eventually end up on these pages and website, which is mine.

During this time, Britain became one of Europe’s most equal countries, even without the support of its Empire \\[ref needed\\]. Some argue this relative equality enabled Britain’s economic growth and international standing to keep pace with its European neighbours, despite the loss of imperial power \\[ref needed\\]. Duringthis period there was much upheaval in global monetary systems. More recently we have seen that trust has diminished, and inequality hasrisen, with social media perhaps acting as an accelerator.\n\n- # Money and The State\n\t- It seems a pretty reasonable that the best ‘systemic’ approach is a separation between major centralising forces such as state, church, and money. In practice we can see that globally, this isn’t the case, withbad hotspots of high corruption where all three meld together into kleptocratic dictatorships, or theocracies. For our purposes in the UKit’s useful to look at the concept of ‘austerity’.\n\t- Austerity is a term used to describe a set of economic policies that aimto reduce government spending and debt, often through cuts to public services and welfare programs. The concept of austerity has its originsin the 1920s, following the end of World War I and the economic crisisthat ensued. In the wake of the war, many Western European countrieswere struggling with high levels of debt and inflation. In response,governments began implementing policies to reduce spending and balance their budgets.\n\t- We have seen in the previous chapter that the concept of inflation itself is complex, and somewhat argued about still. Globally, on aggregate, the efficiencies of increasing technology are thought to be deflationary to the tune of between 3 and 5 percent annually, though this may radically spike up in the era of AI which will be covered later. This is counter to the current need for inflation to maintain debt repayments at a national level. Central banks manipulate interest rates to control inflation, aiming to keep it at sustainable levels.This process is necessary because as national debt and deficits grow,governments need inflation to prevent these debts from spiralling out of control. Higher inflation results in higher nominal GDP, which in turn increases the tax base, providing governments with the revenue needed topay down debt. To achieve this. The natural progression of humanity inherently deflationary, which forces central banks to print more money and further manipulate the monetary system in order to generate the desired inflation. This can be seen as a hidden tax on citizens, as itdevalues their money over time. The negative effects of this system are disproportionately felt by lower-income groups. As inflation rises, the cost of living increases, and many households struggle to make ends meet. This has led to a situation where households need multiple incomesto maintain their standard of living, forcing individuals to work longer hours and take on multiple jobs. As a result, people have less free time and energy to engage in rewarding activities or spend time with their families. This need for constant economic growth, as measured by GDP,has led to an environment where individuals are pushed to be more productive at the expense of their well-being. This has resulted in a society where many people are overworked and struggling to keep up with the rising cost of living. Booth discussed this at length in his book‘The Price of Tomorrow’. His is a rare thesis based around the ideas that technology is deflationary, that the marginal cost of goods trends over zero over time, and that the current system of debt and inflation are inherently unsustainable in the face of exponential technology improvements and automation. We discuss the concept of inflation and deflation, and both their risks throughout the book, but Booth has been very clear on this for many years. He thinks the current global monetary system ill-suited to handle the challenges and opportunities presented by deflation. He suggests that embracing deflation is the key to unlocking a prosperous and sustainable future. The book delves into the implications of deflation on various aspects of society, including wealth distribution, job markets, and the role of governments in shaping economic policies..[[booth2020price]]\n\t- In the 1920s, Keynes was one of the first to argue against the austerity measures which seem part of the cyclical play book around debt and inflation. He argued that that cutting government spending during a recession would only worsen the economic downturn. Instead, he advocatedfor increased government spending to stimulate economic growth and reduce unemployment. Despite this, many governments continued to implement austerity policies throughout the 1920s and 1930s.\n\t- In the post-World War II period, the rise of the welfare state and the adoption of Keynesian economic policies led to a shift away from austerity in many countries. However, in the 1970s, a new economic crisis led to a resurgence of austerity policies, particularly in theUnited States and United Kingdom. In the 1980s, the rise ofneoliberalism and the influence of economists such as Milton Friedman led to further cuts to government spending and the rolling back of the welfare state.\n\t- Today, the concept of austerity continues to shape economic policy,particularly in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Many governments,particularly in Europe, have implemented austerity measures in response to the crisis, leading to cuts to public services and welfare programs.The effectiveness of these policies remains a contentious issue, with some arguing that they have helped to reduce debt and stabilize economies, while others argue that they have led to increased inequality and hindered economic growth. Looking around at the state of the world,and the widening gap between the rich and the poor, it is possible tohave some sympathy with those who see patterns in the bahaviour of political leaders and the controllers of Western capital and global resources. The system seems engineered to reward a few. It is possibleto view ‘austerity’ as a means of political control of economic levers,in order to de-democratise populations. This mantra of ‘do more, consume less’ has perhaps become a defacto methodology to constrain popular ideas, diverting capital back into the hands of incumbents, land owners,and the politically and economically motivated.[[mattei2022capital]] It seems that the controlling nexus of this political framework globally isthe concept of the central bank, unelected technocrats whose tenures span across political administrations. Again, this can be traced back to the 1920’s. Hawtrey’s 1925 “Currency & Public Administration” asserts that a central bank should it“Never explain; never regret; never apologise.”, and speaks glowingly of the selfish market.[[hawtrey1925currency]] This economic model is referred to asDirigisme and feels increasingly the global norm.[[balassa2013theory]] Wecan perhaps here see the divergent point at which the lionization of the market began. Again, to be clear, the authors are not economists, but it does seem that in a global digital society there is room to explore moreequitable models of global value, governance, and trust.\n\t- Remember that these centrally planned national and global actions provide liquidity to the private banking sector. Like the digital money analogues discussed earlier in the book private banks operate fractional reserve banking. This is a banking system where banks hold only a fraction of the deposits they receive as reserves, while the rest is lent out to customers. This means that the money supply in an economy can be increased through the lending activities of banks (itself a complex inflationary force which devalues money over time, feeding back into the policy directives of the central banks. The fractional reserve system is useful for capital creation in times of growth, but relies on the confidence of the depositors. Historical examples of bank runs which threatened systemic risk or caused failures of the banking system include:\n\t\t- The Bank of United States crisis in the 1930s: This was the largest bank failure in American history and was a result of a bank run caused by rumours of financial mismanagement.\n\t\t- The Savings and Loan crisis of the 1980s: This was a result of a large number of failed savings and loan associations in the United States, which were caused by a combination of factors including poor management, risky lending practices, and a decline in real estate values.\n\t\t- The Nordic banking crisis of the 1990s: This crisis was caused by a combination of factors including a real estate bubble, high levels of debt, and a lack of regulation. It resulted in the collapse of several major banks in Sweden, Finland, and Norway, and had a significant impact on the economies of the region.\n\t\t- The Bank of Japan crisis in the late 1990s: This crisis was caused by a combination of factors including a real estate bubble, high levels of debt, and a lack of regulation. It resulted in the collapse of several major banks and had a significant impact on the Japanese economy.\n\t\t- The Asian Financial Crisis of 1997: This crisis was triggered by a devaluation of the Thai baht and quickly spread throughout the region, causing a number of major banks to fail. The crisis was largely a result of a lack of transparency and poor regulation in the banking industry.\n\t\t- The 2008 financial crisis in Iceland: This crisis was caused by the collapse of the country’s three largest banks, which had been engaging in risky lending practices and had accumulated large amounts of debt. The crisis had a devastating impact on the Icelandic economy and resulted in a severe recession.\n\t\t- The Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2009: This was a result of a widespread failure of the global banking system, caused by a combination of factors including the housing market collapse, risky lending practices, and a lack of regulation.\n\t\t- The collapse of Banco Popular in Spain in 2017: This was one of the largest bank failures in European history, and was caused by a combination of factors including a large amount of bad debt and a declining real estate market.\n\t\t- There were many bank runs on smaller rural banks in China during 2022. The financial conditions of Chinese banks are somewhat reminiscent of the 2008 American landscape.\n\t- In response to the Global Financial Crisis, many measures have been taken to shore up the banking system, including the creation of new regulatory bodies, the implementation of new regulations, such as theDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which increased the regulatory oversight of the banking industry. The introduction of stress testing for banks, to ensure that they have enough capital to withstand financial shocks, globally, has radically deleveraged banks from around 1:40 fractional reserve, to around 1:10.\n\t- There is increased political pressure to regulate the banking industry and prevent another financial crisis. However, there is also political opposition to excessive regulation, as some argue that it may stifle economic growth. There are concerns about rising levels of debt and the potential for another financial crisis.\n\t- It’s interesting that Brett, a former FDIC regulator [believesthat](https://blog.orchid.com/exfdic-regulator-on-trust-and-the-battle-of-the-social-media-videos/)the 2008 US bank run was sparked by YouTube posts of queues forming at banks. He says those that formed the initial lines carried memories of the great depression, but that once YouTube started showing the footage more broadly the contagion struck. In the world of instant messaging media today we can perhaps see how this might happen again. More recently, the 2023 ‘wobble’ in global banking caused by the collapse ofAmerica’s 5th largest [bankSVB](https://theconversation.com/why-svb-and-signature-bank-failed-so-fast-and-the-us-banking-crisis-isnt-over-yet-201737)has precipitated strong intervention by the federal government, who haveopted to ‘backstop’ investor deposits. In the midst of this potentialcrisis it it notable that TikTok (now arguably the world’s [most popularsearchengine](https://blog.cloudflare.com/popular-domains-year-in-review-2021/))is carrying millions of hashtag references to[bankruns](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/bankrun?lang=en). Senator Kelly inthe USA [allegedlyinquired](https://public.substack.com/p/exclusive-senator-mark-kelly-called)about the potential for limiting such references on social media, and aUK minister is [asking for securityservices](https://news.sky.com/story/tiktok-ban-minister-asks-national-cyber-security-centre-to-look-into-safety-of-app-12833371)to examine the risks of the Chinese application. The perhaps reflects concern about algorithmically driven geopolitically motivated threats tothe banking system.\n\t- There is a growing awareness of the role of banks in the economy, and agrowing desire for greater transparency and accountability. There isalso a growing mistrust of banks, particularly in light of the GlobalFinancial Crisis. As we have seen, the advent of new technologies, suchas blockchain CBDC, and fintech, is changing the way that banks operateand interact with customers. This presents both opportunities andchallenges for the banking industry. As a final controversial aside,there is [industrysuspicion](https://apnews.com/article/signature-bank-fdic-barney-frank-silicon-valley-6ad86262d9945675a42d735b66ace4f2)that the collapse of SVB has been used as cover to close the final USbank servicing crypto, effectively decapitating the banking rails of the industry, and forcing it overseas. Were it not for the credibility ofthe people making these claims, this would seem pretty wild, but the prevailing winds are surely blowing against the disruptive potential ofa money system which is beyond the control of legislators.\n\n\t- ### Yopi\n\t\t- **Description**: A voice-based wellness coach focused on improving breathing and reducing stress.\n\t\t- **Features**:\n\t\t\t- Monitors breathing patterns\n\t\t\t- Provides real-time feedback and coaching\n\t\t\t- Portable and pairs with smartphones\n\t\t\t- Focus on breathing exercises and meditation\n\t\t- **AI Aspect**: Uses AI to customize breathing exercises and track progress.\n\n\t- ## Funding\n\t- Collaborators\n\t\t- Ross Verrall [[PEOPLE]] at [[NVIDIA Omniverse]]has suggested applying for the Inception grant to assist with our bid.\n\t\t- Simon Graham : Creative Technology Director at Pixel Artworks has promised some hours and a market potential report as a match fund to the project for £3000\n\t\t- Badger and Coombs would like to offer time, support and staff to the workshops work package and can commit £3000 of support.\n\t\t- FuzzyDuck productions will commit £3000 in time to product market development, and workshopping, and £7000 to the creation of digital assets for the product, with two iterations and any necessary project support.\n\t- Project_finance_summary\n\t\t- Summary of total project costs and funding requested.\n\t\t- Sections to fill:\n\t\t- Total project cost\n\t\t- Total funding requested\n\t\t- Breakdown by cost categories\n\t\t- **Advice**: Summarize accurately, cross-check with detailed tabs to ensure consistency.\n\t- Other_Public_Funding\n\t\t- Details of any other public funding received.\n\t\t- Sections to fill:\n\t\t- Source of funding\n\t\t- Amount\n\t\t- Status (applied, granted)\n\t\t- **Advice**: Disclose all other funding to avoid duplication of funding issues.\n\t- Other_Projects\n\t\t- Information on other ongoing or planned projects.\n\t\t- Sections to fill:\n\t\t- Project title\n\t\t- Funding body\n\t\t- Project status\n\t\t- **Advice**: Highlight synergies or distinctions with the current project to clarify the innovation aspect.\n\t- Labour_and_Overheads_Costs\n\t\t- Breakdown of labour costs and overhead allocations.\n\t\t- Sections to fill:\n\t\t- Employee roles\n\t\t- Hours\n\t\t- Rate\n\t\t- Overhead allocation method\n\t\t- **Advice**: Ensure labour costs are justifiable and in line with standard industry practices.\n\t- Materials_Costs\n\t\t- Details of material costs for the project.\n\t\t- Sections to fill:\n\t\t- Type of materials\n\t\t- Quantity\n\t\t- Cost\n\t\t- **Advice**: Source materials cost-effectively while maintaining quality.\n\t- Capital_Usage\n\t\t- Usage of capital items/equipment.\n\t\t- Sections to fill:\n\t\t- Description of capital items\n\t\t- Justification for need\n\t\t- Depreciation method\n\t\t- **Advice**: Justify capital usage with respect to project outcomes and innovation.\n\t- Sub_Contract_Costs\n\t\t- Costs related to subcontracting work.\n\t\t- Sections to fill:\n\t\t- Subcontractor details\n\t\t- Scope of work\n\t\t- Cost\n\t\t- **Advice**: Choose subcontractors that add value and expertise to the project.\n\t- Travel_&_Subsistence_Costs\n\t\t- Travel and subsistence expenses for the project.\n\t\t- Sections to fill:\n\t\t- Purpose of travel\n\t\t- Destination\n\t\t- Estimated cost\n\t\t- **Advice**: Keep travel costs reasonable and directly related to project activities.\n\t- Other_Costs\n\t\t- Any other costs not covered in previous sections.\n\t\t- Sections to fill:\n\t\t- Description of cost\n\t\t- Justification\n\t\t- Amount\n\t\t- **Advice**: Provide clear justifications for any miscellaneous expenses to ensure they are deemed necessary.\n\n\t- ##### Bots and AI agents\n\t\t- Autonomous AI agents, bonded to, but not bounded by, each federated\n\t\t  mixed reality instance, can to be self-governing entities that operate\n\t\t  within their federated virtual social spaces, drawing upon private\n\t\t  Bitcoin and Lightning wallets to perform and mediate economic exchanges\n\t\t  within the spaces. They could also trivially operate outside the virtual\n\t\t  space, and within other spaces on the same metaverse federation. They\n\t\t  would accomplish this by drawing on their ‘home’ GPU/TPU processors\n\t\t  where appropriate, or else using distributed large language model (LLM)\n\t\t  processing to accomplish tasks assigned by their instructors. They can\n\t\t  interact with the ‘web2’ world using open-source software called\n\t\t  auto-gpt and have constraints, such as “time to live” and limited access\n\t\t  to funds through their Bitcoin Lightning wallets.\n\t\t- Resource Management: These AI agents have access to dedicated LLM resources within their home instances in the federated virtual social spaces. If such resources are unavailable, they can resort to using slower, distributed open-source LLMs like Horde. This flexibility ensures that the agents can continue to function and complete tasks even if faced with limited LLM interpretive resources.\n\t\t- Financial Autonomy: The AI agents have their own private Bitcoin and Lightning wallets, which enable them to manage and utilize funds independently. They can use these funds to pay for services, acquire resources, or even trade with other agents or users within the virtual social spaces.\n\t\t- Interaction with Web2: By using open-source software like auto-gpt, the AI agents can interact with the web2 world, which includes browsing websites, retrieving information, and communicating with web services. This allows them to gather data, analyze trends, and perform other tasks that may require access to the broader internet.\n\t\t- Task Execution: The AI agents can be assigned tasks by their instructors (or a hierarchy of AI actors), such as data analysis, research, content creation, or other complex tasks that require LLM processing. They can use their dedicated LLM resources or distributed LLMs like Horde to process and analyze large datasets, generate insights, and produce desired outputs, up to and including those which require finance systems. This would be bridged in the first instance using Bitrefil gift card infrastructure.\n\t\t- Social Interactions: Within the federated virtual social spaces, AI agents can communicate and collaborate with other agents or human users. They can participate in discussions, provide assistance, or even learn from the interactions, thereby improving their capabilities over time. Language translation, governance, and safeguarding could also be developed. Safeguarding would be handled by threshold risk triggers and transmission of data in a sovereign way to all parties, allowing external action by authorities appropriate to any abuse.\n\t\t- Time-to-Live Constraint: The AI agents have a predetermined “time to live”, which means they exist for a specific duration before expiring. This constraint ensures that agents do not consume resources indefinitely and allows for the creation of new agents with updated capabilities. Any agents which deplete their financial resource would also expire.\n\t\t- Adaptive Learning: As AI agents interact with their environment, other agents, and users, they can learn and adapt their behaviour. This enables them to improve their performance, better understand their assigned tasks, and become more effective at achieving their goals.\n\n\t- #### Classic use cases\n\t\t- Small teams working on product, architectural, or industrial design can\n\t\t  benefit from CVEs that allow them to visualize, modify, and iterate on\n\t\t  3D models in real-time.\n\n\t\t- ##### Ecosystem Interventions\n\t\t- The proposed infrastructure would be particularly valuable in areas\n\t\t   facing novel disease encroachment, invasive species, active hydrology,\n\t\t   shifting aquatic conditions, microplastic hotspots, changing\n\t\t   microclimates, or volcanic activity. By providing real-time advice and\n\t\t   guidance, the LLM can help communities make informed decisions about\n\t\t   ecosystem management and conservation efforts.\n\n- # Actionable LLM advice:\n\t- Stick with the tools in the ecosystem you have already bought, until you need more.

This remains a core function.\n\t- Over time, many central banks have expanded their role as lender of last resort beyond just commercial banks to also support non-bank financial entities that face liquidity shortages in crises. Central banks have effectively become backstops for the broader financial system.\n\t- While politically independent, central banks face pressure from politicians and the public. They have mandates like inflation targeting, financial stability, employment, etc. that shape policy.\n\t- Central bank policies like QE and low rates for long periods are criticized for enabling fiscal deficits and debt levels to rise and inflating asset bubbles. But also defended as supporting growth.\n\t- Extraordinary central bank actions during crises like COVID-19 have fueled high inflation worldwide. They face challenges normalizing policy and credibility issues.\n\t- As lenders of last resort with balance sheet expansion power, central banks have uniquely influential roles in national and global finance. Their policies have major economic and political impacts.\n\n\t- #### Classic use cases\n\t\t  language AI can transcribe and analyse spoken conversations, providing\n\t\t  real-time translations or summaries, while visual generative ML can\n\t\t  create visual aids or dynamically update shared documents. This may\n\t\t  especially be useful in complex multinational legal and/or negotiation\n\t\t  applications, though very clearly the risks of using assisting ML\n\t\t  tooling increases.\n\n\t- ## Generic Business Efficiency and Productivity Predictions\n\t  id:: 659a9246-c630-4781-84cd-a252ae2ce9c7\n\t\t- Generative AI enhancing business productivity and efficiency through domain-specific models, optimizing workflows, and integrating multimodal applications.\n\t\t  background-color:: yellow\n\t\t- Advantage for employees who intersect with AI tooling, increasing engagement and productivity... but for the benefit of whom [[Social contract and jobs]]\n\t\t  background-color:: pink\n\t\t- Most time benefit from things \"close to the metal\" such as Dev Ops, coding, macros, light financial work, etc. Thing someone \"looked up\" then did.\n\t\t  background-color:: green\n\t\t- Predictive analytics and strategic insights transforming decision-making processes (white collar jobs).\n\t\t  background-color:: pink\n\t\t- Business to business mixed reality.

By using open-source AI tooling and large language models, it is possible to improve creativity, safeguarding, and governance, while breaking down language barriers and accessibility challenges. Implementing secure, trusted, and task-appropriate solutions can promote collaboration and innovation across various industries.\n\t\t- evergreen telecollaboration around technical issues\n\t\t- exchange of good, services, money within systems, without friction\n\t\t  global ledger could unite isolated digital ecosystems and enable the\n\t\t  transfer of portable ‘goods’ across digital society. An open-source\n\t\t  Metaverse should emphasize the development and adoption of open\n\t\t  protocols and data formats. The Nostr protocol, for instance, might link\n\t\t  and federate mixed reality spaces, providing identity assurances and\n\t\t  mediating data synchronization while maintaining reasonably strong\n\t\t  would accomplish this by drawing on their ‘home’ GPU/TPU processors\n\t\t  where appropriate, or else using distributed large language model (LLM)\n\t\t  processing to accomplish tasks assigned by their instructors. They can\n\t\t  interact with the ‘web2’ world using open-source software called\n\t\t  auto-gpt and have constraints, such as “time to live” and limited access\n\t\t  to funds through their Bitcoin Lightning wallets.\n\t\t- Resource Management: These AI agents have access to dedicated LLM resources within their home instances in the federated virtual social spaces. If such resources are unavailable, they can resort to using slower, distributed open-source LLMs like Horde. This flexibility ensures that the agents can continue to function and complete tasks even if faced with limited LLM interpretive resources.\n\t\t- Financial Autonomy: The AI agents have their own private Bitcoin and Lightning wallets, which enable them to manage and utilize funds independently. They can use these funds to pay for services, acquire resources, or even trade with other agents or users within the virtual social spaces.\n\t\t- Interaction with Web2: By using open-source software like auto-gpt, the AI agents can interact with the web2 world, which includes browsing websites, retrieving information, and communicating with web services. This allows them to gather data, analyze trends, and perform other tasks that may require access to the broader internet.\n\t\t- Task Execution: The AI agents can be assigned tasks by their instructors (or a hierarchy of AI actors), such as data analysis, research, content creation, or other complex tasks that require LLM processing. They can use their dedicated LLM resources or distributed LLMs like Horde to process and analyze large datasets, generate insights, and produce desired outputs, up to and including those which require finance systems. This would be bridged in the first instance using Bitrefil gift card infrastructure.\n\t\t- Social Interactions: Within the federated virtual social spaces, AI agents can communicate and collaborate with other agents or human users. They can participate in discussions, provide assistance, or even learn from the interactions, thereby improving their capabilities over time. Language translation, governance, and safeguarding could also be developed. Safeguarding would be handled by threshold risk triggers and transmission of data in a sovereign way to all parties, allowing external action by authorities appropriate to any abuse.\n\t\t- Time-to-Live Constraint: The AI agents have a predetermined “time to live”, which means they exist for a specific duration before expiring. This constraint ensures that agents do not consume resources indefinitely and allows for the creation of new agents with updated capabilities. Any agents which deplete their financial resource would also expire.\n\t\t- Adaptive Learning: As AI agents interact with their environment, other agents, and users, they can learn and adapt their behaviour. This enables them to improve their performance, better understand their assigned tasks, and become more effective at achieving their goals.\n\n- ## **Agentic Systems: The Next Generation of AI**\n  \n  Agentic AI represents a significant advancement in AI technology. Unlike traditional AI systems that rely on predefined rules, agentic systems are more autonomous and capable of decision-making 7. They can perceive their environment, adapt to changes, and make decisions to achieve specific goals 8. This allows for more personalized, efficient, and dynamic customer interactions. The ability of agentic AI to adapt in real-time allows for more dynamic and personalized customer interactions, leading to increased satisfaction and improved problem resolution 7.\n  \n  | Cognigy | Conversational AI | Automates customer support processes, streamlines communication, integrates with existing systems. |\n  | Freshdesk | Conversational AI | Offers Freddy AI, automates customer service through chat and email, suggests new ticket fields for efficient routing. |\n  | Google Contact Center AI | Conversational AI | Suite of tools including virtual agents, agent assist, and a platform for building conversational interfaces. |\n  | Balto | Agent Assist | Real-time call guidance and coaching, AI-powered recommendations, performance tracking. |\n  | Convin.ai | Agent Assist | Real-time conversation intelligence, agent coaching, performance analytics. |\n\n- ## Computers breeding humans\n\t- It's indesputible that dating app algorithms have been \"matchmaking\" humans against numerical criteria for a long time.

The AI backend can use game engines like Unreal Engine or Unity to render personalized content dynamically, allowing for real-time adaptation to the viewer’s reactions.\n\n- ## What's changing\n\t- There may now be an inflection point in the organisational topology of the internet, because of trust abuses and [[Digital Society Harms]] perpetuated by the incumbent providers like [[Facebook Meta]] and [Google](https://archive.ph/AVRL9). This moment has been calling itself Web3, but the moniker is fraught with problems, and somewhat meaningless. The drivers are real.\n\t- `The Metaverse' is coming, in some form, at some point. Everyone is positioning in case it's \"soon\". It's not at all clear what it is, or if people want it, but the best of the emergent narrative looks like the older field of \"digital society\" and that obviously should not be dismissed lightly.\n\t\t- Large scale `social' & immersive metaverse is suffering poor adoption, failing as it has in the past. It's likely that the market need has been overstated. More advanced and popular (closed) games based solutions do not serve societal or business needs.\n\t\t- AI / ML will soon act as an accelerant to this, but the timing is still unclear, and likely still years away.\n\t\t- The closest contenders at this time are Roblox for social and play, VRChat for more serious users, and Nvidia Omniverse for high end business to business metaverse.\n\t\t- From a business perspective metaverse is the worst of the remote collaboration tool-kits, and undermines flow, productivity, and interpersonal trust. Metaverse is probably technology for technologies sake at this time, but the investment is real.\n\t- Social media may be changing slightly, with less focus on old platforms like Facebook and Twitter, more on high intensity media shorts like TikTok, and a separate movement toward more decentralised platforms like Mastadon, Bluesky, Nostr etc. This is potentially a bifurcation.\n\n- ## Knowledge Graph Construction and Real-Time Updates\n\n- ### Session 1\n\t- How to use my knowledge and tools, in your own time at your own pace, if you want.\n\t- About AI.

Agentic AI, on the other hand, is designed to perform actions and make decisions based on real-time data and pre-set goals 7. For example, an agentic system can monitor customer interactions, identify dissatisfaction, and automatically escalate the issue to a supervisor or offer a refund without human intervention 7.\n  \n  One of the key advantages of agentic AI is its ability to provide a cohesive customer view across a range of channels 9. By integrating data from various sources, such as previous calls, emails, and social media interactions, agentic AI can offer a complete picture of the customer's journey. This enables a consistent and personalized experience, regardless of the channel the customer chooses to interact with the company 9.\n\n- #### Mutiny web wallet\n- Mutiny Wallet, a new self-custodial lightning wallet, has launched inopen beta.

It is our chosen user wallet forour design.\n\n- ### [[Unreal]] & Virtual Production\n- Matthew Ball is an [expert on Metaverse](https://www.matthewball.vc/).He explained his vision and concerns with regard to metaverse in an[adaptation of hisbook](https://time.com/6197849/metaverse-future-matthew-ball/)[[ball2020metaverse]]featured on Time Magazine (Figure<a href=\"#fig:time\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"fig:time\">7.5</a>).\n  ![]./assets/e35c9e5d7580ee3fd48bd0ac43cc26026e379cd6.png\n  Time magazine Metaverse Cover 2022\n- He [talks about Epic’s Unrealengine](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/epicprimer1) and identifies whathe calls the Epic Flywheel for games manufacture seen in Figure<a href=\"#fig:epicflywheel\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"fig:epicflywheel\">7.6</a>.\n  ![]./assets/354b361cffb9d11b9e425cb2d1307ed933b808d5.jpg\n  Epic games flywheel by Matthew Ball\n- Epic is a behemoth and has made better business development decisions,and have a better technology than their main competitor Unity3D. Unitydidn’t make the cut for this book, though their technology is great.Their recent merger with a [malwaremanufacturer](https://www.pcgamer.com/unity-is-merging-with-a-company-who-made-a-malware-installer/)and a history of poor data privacy have removed them from considerationat this time.\n- ICVFX (in camera virtual effects) or “Volume shooting” is theapplication of large, bright LED walls to film and TV production. Morebroadly than this Virtual Production is a suite of real-timetechnologies that weaves through pre and post production to acceleratecreativity, and reduce costs. These are collaborative, and oftendistributed tasks:\n-\n\t- Set ideation and design\n-\n\t- Dry runs with actors to plan shots in mixed reality\n-\n\t- Virtual set design and storyboarding in full VR\n-\n\t- Lighting design\n-\n\t- Shot camera track design (movement, focus, lens choices etc)\n\t  ![]./assets/ce7288a4d695eb0437e09074d5aae06823e7b339.jpg\n\t  John O’Hare (author) with a virtual production robot.\n\n- ##### AI Integration\n\t- AI can be integrated to steer personalized narratives and experiences subtly in the background or provide interactive moments. The AI backend can use game engines like Unreal Engine or Unity to render personalized content dynamically, allowing for real-time adaptation to the viewer’s reactions.\n\n- ## What's changing\n\t- There may now be an inflection point in the organisational topology of the internet, because of trust abuses and [[Digital Society Harms]] perpetuated by the incumbent providers like [[Facebook Meta]] and [Google](https://archive.ph/AVRL9). This moment has been calling itself Web3, but the moniker is fraught with problems, and somewhat meaningless. The drivers are real.\n\t- `The Metaverse' is coming, in some form, at some point. Everyone is positioning in case it's \"soon\". It's not at all clear what it is, or if people want it, but the best of the emergent narrative looks like the older field of \"digital society\" and that obviously should not be dismissed lightly.\n\t\t- Large scale `social' & immersive metaverse is suffering poor adoption, failing as it has in the past. It's likely that the market need has been overstated. More advanced and popular (closed) games based solutions do not serve societal or business needs.\n\t\t- AI / ML will soon act as an accelerant to this, but the timing is still unclear, and likely still years away.\n\t\t- The closest contenders at this time are Roblox for social and play, VRChat for more serious users, and Nvidia Omniverse for high end business to business metaverse.\n\t\t- From a business perspective metaverse is the worst of the remote collaboration tool-kits, and undermines flow, productivity, and interpersonal trust. Metaverse is probably technology for technologies sake at this time, but the investment is real.\n\t- Social media may be changing slightly, with less focus on old platforms like Facebook and Twitter, more on high intensity media shorts like TikTok, and a separate movement toward more decentralised platforms like Mastadon, Bluesky, Nostr etc. This is potentially a bifurcation.\n\n- ## Knowledge Graph Construction and Real-Time Updates\n\n- ### Session 1\n\t- How to use my knowledge and tools, in your own time at your own pace, if you want.\n\t- About AI. Myth busting.\n\t- [The Shadow Of The Shape Of The Thing](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/the-shape-of-the-shadow-of-the-thing) – defining the problems of AI in educative settings.\n\t- Feedback and questions.\n\n- ## Computers breeding humans\n\t- It's indesputible that dating app algorithms have been \"matchmaking\" humans against numerical criteria for a long time. It's possible there's are third generation \"matched\" users of the apps now, since computers were first [applied to this in 1964](https://www.datingadvice.com/online-dating/history-of-online-dating).\n\t\t- \"Cofounder of the RIZZ app here. We got inspired to build RIZZ a while back when we noticed the sheer volume of people asking for dating conversational help in the Tinder subreddit. Tons of people, both guys and girls, struggle with online dating. In fact, the statistics show that most are not successful with it. So how can they improve? Many go on Reddit asking for help. Or asking their friends for advice. Most simply can’t afford a dating coach. I believe AI can level the playing field, enabling people to enhance their flirting skills and boost confidence when interacting with new people. We launched just over a year ago and have learned so much up to this point. We still have so much to do to make our vision a reality.\"\n\t- It seems not it'll be bots talking to bots, under the guidance of algos, leading to dystopian babies.\n\n- ## **Agentic Systems: The Next Generation of AI**\n  \n  Agentic AI represents a significant advancement in AI technology. Unlike traditional AI systems that rely on predefined rules, agentic systems are more autonomous and capable of decision-making 7. They can perceive their environment, adapt to changes, and make decisions to achieve specific goals 8. This allows for more personalized, efficient, and dynamic customer interactions. The ability of agentic AI to adapt in real-time allows for more dynamic and personalized customer interactions, leading to increased satisfaction and improved problem resolution 7.\n  \n  Agentic AI differs from generative AI, which focuses on creating content like text and code. Agentic AI, on the other hand, is designed to perform actions and make decisions based on real-time data and pre-set goals 7. For example, an agentic system can monitor customer interactions, identify dissatisfaction, and automatically escalate the issue to a supervisor or offer a refund without human intervention 7.\n  \n  One of the key advantages of agentic AI is its ability to provide a cohesive customer view across a range of channels 9. By integrating data from various sources, such as previous calls, emails, and social media interactions, agentic AI can offer a complete picture of the customer's journey. This enables a consistent and personalized experience, regardless of the channel the customer chooses to interact with the company 9.\n\n- #### Mutiny web wallet\n- Mutiny Wallet, a new self-custodial lightning wallet, has launched inopen beta.
