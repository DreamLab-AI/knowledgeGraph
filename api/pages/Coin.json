Unlike [[tokens]], which are built on existing blockchain platforms, coins operate as the native currency of their own independent blockchains.\n\n\n- ### Key Characteristics\n  id:: coin-characteristics\n\n  - #### Definitional Properties\n\n    Coins function as the primary economic mechanism within their native blockchain ecosystems, enabling value transfer, transaction validation, and network security through [[consensus mechanisms]]. They possess intrinsic utility within their respective networks, serving as the fundamental unit of exchange and incentive structure.\n\n  - #### Functional Properties\n\n    Operationally, coins facilitate peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries, provide cryptographic security through [[public-key cryptography]], and enable [[decentralized]] value storage and transfer. They serve as compensation for network participants who validate transactions through [[mining]] or [[staking]] mechanisms.\n\n  - #### Structural Properties\n\n    Compositionally, coins are recorded on distributed ledgers maintained across network nodes, with supply mechanisms typically defined by protocol-level rules. Most implementations feature predetermined supply schedules, divisibility to fractional units, and immutable transaction histories.\n\n  - #### Security Properties\n\n    Coins inherit security guarantees from their underlying blockchain networks, including censorship resistance, double-spend prevention through distributed consensus, and cryptographic authentication of ownership and transfers.\n\n\n- ### 2024-2025 Coin Ecosystem Maturation\n  id:: coin-recent-developments\n\n  The cryptocurrency coin ecosystem experienced remarkable maturation from 2024 through 2025, transitioning from speculative assets to functional infrastructure supporting global finance, [[AI agent economies]], and institutional treasury management. [[Bitcoin]]'s role as potential \"native currency of AI\" gained traction as autonomous agents required programmable, borderless payment rails without traditional banking intermediaries. [Updated 2025]\n\n  - #### Bitcoin Development and Infrastructure\n\n    Bitcoin processed over **1 billion transactions** by 2024, establishing itself as proven infrastructure for micropayments and [[machine-to-machine commerce]]. The [[Bitcoin]] development ecosystem comprised approximately **500 dedicated developers** out of a broader cryptocurrency pool of 9,000 contributors (predominantly distributed across [[Ethereum]] and [[Solana]] projects). [Updated 2025]\n\n    Development emphasis remained on careful iteration to preserve network integrity, with innovation increasingly shifting to [[Layer 2]] and [[Layer 3]] protocols ([[Lightning Network]], [[RGB Protocol]]) that enabled programmable assets and smart contracts whilst inheriting Bitcoin's security. The multi-trillion-dollar digital asset class now served over 100 million Bitcoin users specifically, with the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem exceeding 500 million users.\n\n    Multiple codebases support the Bitcoin network: **Bitcoin Core** (C++, historical reference implementation), **LibBitcoin** (C++ alternative), **BTCD** (Go), and **BitcoinJ** (Java). As Layer 1 innovation slowed deliberately, development attention shifted to protocols interacting with the base layer: Lightning Network for payments, RGB Protocol for smart contracts and digital assets, [[Nostr]] for decentralised identity, and emerging infrastructure for [[decentralised storage]].\n\n  - #### Institutional and Sovereign Adoption [Updated 2025]\n\n    According to Chainalysis' 2024 Crypto Adoption Index, **India, Nigeria, and Vietnam** led per capita adoption, whilst the **United States** ranked fourth driven by institutional investment. In a watershed moment, **the United States established a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in March 2025** through executive order, becoming the first nation to hold Bitcoin as a national reserve asset—fundamentally legitimising cryptocurrency as sovereign treasury holdings.\n\n    The U.S. held 207,189 BTC ($20.24 billion) seized from criminal investigations, whilst China held 194,000 BTC ($18.95 billion) confiscated from the PlusToken Ponzi scheme, though official policy remained restrictive towards public cryptocurrency usage. This dichotomy—governments accumulating Bitcoin whilst restricting citizen access—illustrated the asset's perceived strategic value despite ideological opposition to [[decentralised finance]].\n\n\n- ### Global Cryptocurrency Ownership [Updated 2025]\n  id:: coin-global-adoption\n\n  As of 2024, global digital currency ownership averages **6.8%**, representing over **560 million owners worldwide**, marking a **34% increase** from 420 million owners in 2023. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2018 to 2023 was 99%, far outpacing traditional payment methods (8% CAGR).\n\n  - #### Demographics and Distribution\n\n    Ownership demographics show **61% male, 39% female** globally, with **34% of owners aged 25-34**. Asia leads in total owners with 326.8 million, followed by North America with 72.2 million. Payment preferences indicate 65% of owners prefer crypto payments for transactions.\n\n  - #### Regional Adoption Leaders [Updated 2025]\n\n    - **United Arab Emirates:** 31.0% ownership rate\n    - **Singapore:** 24.4%\n    - **Turkey:** 19.3%\n    - **Argentina:** 18.9%\n    - **Thailand:** 17.6%\n    - **Brazil:** 17.5%\n\n  - #### Country-Specific Adoption Patterns\n\n    - **United States:** By 2025, estimates range from 21% (55 million) to 28% (65 million) of adults owning crypto, with ownership skewing young (82% are 18-44 years old). Millennials account for 57% of U.S. crypto owners, followed by Gen X (20%), Gen Z (13%), and Baby Boomers (10%). Notably, 44% of U.S. owners have incomes above $100,000.\n\n    - **Sub-Saharan Africa:** Led global stablecoin adoption with 9.3% of residents using stablecoins by 2025, with **Nigeria** topping global rankings at 11.9% (approximately 25.9 million people), driven by naira instability, capital controls, and remittance needs.\n\n    - **Argentina:** Nearly 20% of Argentine citizens hold cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin overtaking stablecoins as the preferred digital asset during 2024-2025 amid 276% inflation. Argentina leads Latin America in crypto adoption, with the crypto market projected to reach US$940.9 million in 2025. Academic research frequently cites Argentina as a real-world test of Bitcoin's function as an inflation hedge.\n\n    - **Russia:** 10.1% ownership (14.6 million people) in 2022, with government approval for crypto in cross-border transactions despite restrictive domestic policies.\n\n  - #### Usage Patterns and Adoption Drivers\n\n    27% of individuals acquired crypto for online transactions, with 39% reporting regular use for purchases. Ownership is diversifying beyond tech-savvy speculators to include a broad range of ages and income levels. Regional trends show Asia-Pacific leading in ownership, with rapid growth in Central Asia (Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan), whilst South America and Oceania more than doubled their crypto users in one year.\n\n  - **Related Concepts:** [[Cryptocurrency adoption]], [[Digital currency demographics]], [[Global financial inclusion]], [[Hyperinflation]], [[Store of value]]\n\n\n- ### Stablecoin Dominance [Updated 2025]\n  id:: coin-stablecoins\n\n  Whilst [[Bitcoin]] captured headlines and speculative attention, **stablecoins**—particularly [[USDT]] and [[USDC]]—represented the dominant cryptocurrency use case by transfer volume, creating a de facto shadow banking system processing trillions monthly.\n\n  - #### Market Scale and Growth\n\n    Total stablecoin market capitalisation reached **$251.7 billion** by mid-2025, representing **63% growth** in 12 months. Monthly transfer volumes exceeded **$5 trillion**, with **USDC alone accounting for $2.7 trillion** (up from $1.1 trillion in February 2024). This exceeded PayPal's monthly transaction volume ($1.36 trillion in 2024) and approached Visa's global payment volume ($14 trillion annually, ~$1.2 trillion monthly).\n\n    Active stablecoin addresses increased from **19.6 million** (February 2024) to **30 million** (February 2025), representing 53% growth in active participants.\n\n  - #### Tether (USDT) vs. Circle (USDC) Duopoly\n\n    - **Tether (USDT):** Maintained **$155 billion** market capitalisation (approximately 65-70% market share) by mid-2025, remaining the largest stablecoin despite regulatory pressures and persistent concerns around reserve transparency. USDT's dominance reflected network effects in peer-to-peer remittance markets and developing economies where users prioritised accessibility over regulatory pedigree.\n\n    - **USD Coin (USDC):** Grew to **$64 billion** market capitalisation (24.3% market share in Q1 2025), representing over 100% growth in 2024-2025. USDC's institutional positioning—full reserve attestations by major accounting firms, compliance with U.S. regulations, partnerships with traditional finance (Visa, PayPal, [[Stripe]])—attracted institutional and enterprise adoption. When measured by transfer volume rather than market cap, USDC dominated with **66% market share** ($2.7 trillion monthly), reflecting its role as institutional payment infrastructure.\n\n  - #### Geographic Adoption and \"Dollarisation 2.0\"\n\n    Stablecoins enabled \"Dollarisation 2.0\" in contexts of fiat currency failure, where citizens held digital dollars outside government control. In Argentina, Turkey, and Venezuela—countries experiencing chronic inflation—mass migration to stablecoins occurred as inflation hedges and dollar substitutes. This geographic pattern revealed stablecoins' primary utility: not blockchain experimentation, but **monetary stability and capital flight**.\n\n  - #### Regulatory Watershed: EU MiCA and U.S. GENIUS Act [Updated 2025]\n\n    2024-2025 marked stablecoins' transition from regulatory grey zone to formally regulated instruments:\n\n    - **EU Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation** (effective mid-2024): Established comprehensive standards including full reserve requirements (1:1 reserves in cash or liquid equivalents), transparency obligations (regular third-party audits), and authorised issuer requirements. On March 3, 2025, Binance **delisted multiple prominent stablecoins** including USDT, TrueUSD (TUSD), Pax Dollar (USDP), Dai (DAI), and First Digital USD (FDUSD) for European users due to non-compliance, forcing migration to MiCA-compliant alternatives, primarily USDC.\n\n    - **U.S. GENIUS Act** (passed U.S. House July 17, 2025): Implemented the first federal regulatory framework for U.S. dollar stablecoins, establishing payment stablecoin issuer registration with federal banking regulators, reserve composition requirements, monthly attestations by independent auditors, and prohibition on unbacked algorithmic stablecoins (eliminating TerraUSD-style designs).\n\n  - #### Blockchain Distribution Dynamics\n\n    - **Ethereum:** Maintained dominance for stablecoin issuance (approximately 60-65% of total supply), reflecting smart contract maturity and institutional preference\n    - **Tron:** Hosted approximately 45-50% of USDT supply by mid-2025, driven by near-zero transaction fees (~$0.01 vs. Ethereum ~$0.50-2.00)\n    - **Solana:** Emerged as fastest-growing stablecoin network, expanding from 1.6% to 5.4% market share through 2024-2025\n    - **Base** (Coinbase's Layer 2): Grew from 0.2% to 1.8%, reflecting institutional on-ramp integration\n\n  - #### Stripe Acquires Bridge: Institutional Validation [Updated 2025]\n\n    On October 22, 2024, fintech giant [[Stripe]] acquired stablecoin infrastructure firm Bridge for **$1.1 billion**, marking the largest acquisition in crypto history and Stripe's most significant purchase to date. The acquisition underscored Stripe's commitment to stablecoins as future payment infrastructure.\n\n    Patrick Collison, CEO of Stripe, stated: \"Stable coins are room temperature superconductors for financial services. Thanks to stable coins, businesses around the world will benefit from significant speed, coverage, and cost improvements in the coming years.\"\n\n    Bridge's platform facilitates stablecoin payments across 70 countries, with Stripe aiming to build the world's best stablecoin infrastructure, integrating multiple stablecoins and partnering with firms like [[Paxos]] for backend infrastructure. Industry observers likened the acquisition to \"an Instagram-like all-time great acquisition,\" signaling to venture capitalists that stablecoin startups have clearer paths to significant exits.\n\n  - #### Major Stablecoin Implementations\n\n    - **USDC (USD Coin):** Dollar and Euro backed coin issued by a consortium including Circle and Coinbase, with better transparency record than Tether. Fully positioned to take advantage of regulatory changes in the USA, with substantial traditional finance backing. Runs on Ethereum, Algorand, Solana, Stellar, Tron, Hedera, Avalanche and Flow blockchains. Payment provider Stripe supports USDC as of 2024. Circle received major boost as only stablecoin initially allowed in the EU under MiCA.\n\n    - **Binance USD (BUSD):** Dollar equivalent token from global crypto exchange Binance, released in partnership with Paxos. Claims 100% backing by dollars or US treasuries, regulated under New York state financial services with monthly attestation reports.\n\n    - **MakerDAO Dai:** Ethereum-based stablecoin governed by a DAO since 2014. Excess collateral above the value of dai-dollars is voted upon before commitment to cryptographic vaults as backing. Despite problems with DAOs and Ethereum, DAI is well-regarded by its community with healthy billion-dollar issuance.\n\n    - **TrueUSD:** Claims full backing by US dollars held in escrow, running on Ethereum blockchain. Attestation reports available on demand with claimed fully insured deposits, though portion of backing is 'cash equivalents'.\n\n    - **Gemini GUSD:** Reserves \"held and maintained at State Street Bank and Trust Company and within a money market fund managed by Goldman Sachs Asset Management, invested only in U.S. Treasury obligations.\"\n\n    - **TerraUSD (UST):** **Historical collapse 2022** - An experimental algorithmic stablecoin that worked with LUNA token on Cosmos blockchain through arbitrage mechanism. The 'great depegging' saw LUNA crash to essentially zero, destroying some $50 billion of capital, serving as cautionary tale for algorithmic stablecoins and Bitcoin reserve strategies.\n\n  - **Related Concepts:** [[Stablecoin]], [[USDT]], [[USDC]], [[DeFi]], [[Digital dollar]], [[Payments infrastructure]], [[Regulatory frameworks]]\n\n\n- ### Memecoin Phenomenon [Updated 2025]\n  id:: coin-memecoins\n\n  In stark contrast to stablecoins' utilitarian purpose, **memecoins** represented cryptocurrency's pure speculative frontier, where coins with no technical innovation or utility accrued tens of billions in market capitalisation through social coordination, viral marketing, and retail FOMO.\n\n  - #### Market Explosion and Contraction\n\n    Total memecoin market capitalisation grew from approximately **$20 billion** (January 2024) to peak **$132 billion** (December 2024)—a **560% increase**—before consolidating to approximately **$73-90 billion** by early 2025, representing approximately 3-4% of total cryptocurrency market capitalisation.\n\n  - #### Leading Memecoins Performance [Updated 2025]\n\n    - **Dogecoin (DOGE):** The original 2013 joke coin maintained **$27+ billion** market capitalisation by mid-2025, ranking among top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap. DOGE surged 221% in 30 days during late 2024 bull market, driven by Elon Musk's continued public endorsements and speculation around potential Twitter/X payment integration. Dogecoin dominated memecoin market share at approximately 53%.\n\n    - **Shiba Inu (SHIB):** The \"Dogecoin killer\" (launched 2020) held **$8.5 billion** market capitalisation, representing approximately 44% of memecoin market share. SHIB's ecosystem expansion—ShibaSwap decentralised exchange, Shibarium Layer 2 blockchain, metaverse and NFT initiatives—attempted to add utility justifications to speculative meme origins.\n\n    - **Pepe (PEPE):** The 2023 breakout memecoin based on internet meme character achieved 125% price surge in 30 days and surpassed Dogecoin in 24-hour trading volume ($3.88 billion vs. $1.9 billion). PEPE's zero-utility positioning—explicitly marketed as \"useless memecoin\"—represented memecoin purism: rejecting utility theatre in favour of honest speculation.\n\n    - **Dogwifhat (WIF):** Solana-based memecoin featuring a dog wearing a hat briefly achieved #3 memecoin ranking by market cap. Binance listing (early 2025) triggered immediate 25% price jump, demonstrating exchange listings' market-making power for memecoins.\n\n  - #### Sociological Analysis and Criticism\n\n    Memecoins represented **speculative social coordination** without pretense of technological innovation. Unlike utility tokens claiming governance, payments, or infrastructure functionality, memecoins embraced explicit purposelessness—value derived entirely from collective belief and network effects, mirroring fiat currency fundamentals (dollars have value because others believe they have value) without central authority backing.\n\n    Value proposition centred on **community engagement**, viral marketing, and social media coordination rather than technical roadmaps. Success required sustained attention economy manipulation—memes, influencer endorsements, celebrity involvement.\n\n    Proponents argued memecoins **democratised speculation**, enabling retail participants to achieve life-changing gains (e.g., early DOGE/SHIB buyers achieving 10,000%+ returns). Critics countered memecoins constituted **negative-sum gambling** where early buyers extracted wealth from late entrants (greater fool theory), with whale holders controlling supply and orchestrating pump-and-dump schemes.\n\n  - #### Declining Dominance and Market Maturation\n\n    By mid-2025, memecoin dominance declined within broader altcoin markets after peak late-2024 enthusiasm. Market share contracted from 4-5% of total crypto market cap (peak December 2024) to 2-3% (mid-2025) as capital rotated toward **AI-crypto tokens**, **real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation**, and **institutional DeFi** protocols offering revenue generation rather than pure speculation.\n\n    The memecoin phenomenon exposed cryptocurrency's dual nature: simultaneously **revolutionary financial infrastructure** (stablecoins processing trillions) and **speculative gambling casino** (memecoins with zero utility accruing billions)—a tension defining the ecosystem's legitimacy battles with regulators and traditional finance.\n\n  - #### Civic Engagement Dimension\n\n    Emerging research suggests memecoins serve as grassroots civic engagement mechanisms, enabling communities to coordinate around shared ideas and mobilise resources without traditional intermediaries. This represents novel form of social capital formation, though long-term societal implications remain contested.\n\n  - **Related Concepts:** [[Memecoin]], [[Dogecoin]], [[Shiba Inu]], [[Speculative assets]], [[Social coordination]], [[Network effects]], [[Greater fool theory]]\n\n\n- ### Tokenisation Paradigm [Updated 2025]\n  id:: coin-tokenisation\n\n  Tokenisation represents a paradigm shift from traditional cryptocurrencies. The concept was introduced and popularised by the wider crypto movement and its ambitious claims around 'tokenising everything'. After the 'initial coin offering' craze of 2018, attention shifted elsewhere. However, the 'Office of the Comptroller of the Currency' and the BIS have been focusing on resolving settlement issues within financial systems.\n\n  This innovation deviates from blockchain dependency and offers a more streamlined approach to financial transactions. The OCC's tokenisation symposium held on February 8th, 2024, explored aspirations of integrating different types of money and assets on a unified platform, featuring keynotes from prominent figures in the financial world, highlighting the burgeoning interest in tokenisation.\n\n  - **Related Concepts:** [[Tokenization]], [[Real-world assets]], [[Settlement systems]], [[Financial infrastructure]]\n\n\n- ### Technical Standards and References\n  id:: coin-standards\n\n  - **ISO/IEC 23257:2021** - Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies - Reference architecture\n  - **IEEE 2418.1** - Standard for the Framework of Blockchain Use in Internet of Things (IoT)\n  - **NIST NISTIR** - Blockchain Technology Overview\n  - **Academic Research:** A Bitcoin Research Agenda: 100 Critical Information Gaps for Policy (2025)\n\n  - **Related Concepts:** [[ISO standards]], [[IEEE standards]], [[NIST]], [[Technical specifications]], [[Interoperability]]\n\n\n- ### See Also\n  id:: coin-related-concepts\n\n  - [[Bitcoin]]\n  - [[Blockchain]]\n  - [[Token]]\n  - [[Stablecoin]]\n  - [[Digital Currency]]\n  - [[Cryptocurrency]]\n  - [[Lightning Network]]\n  - [[Layer 2]]\n  - [[DeFi]]\n  - [[Ethereum]]\n  - [[Solana]]\n  - [[Consensus Mechanisms]]\n  - [[Mining]]\n  - [[Staking]]\n  - [[Smart Contracts]]\n  - [[Decentralised Finance]]\n\n\npublic:: true",
