(2021). Self-sovereign identity. *Internet Policy Review*, 10(2). https://doi.org/10.14763/2021.2.1550\n  - Pava-Díaz, R. A. (2024). Self-sovereign identity on the blockchain: contextual analysis and challenges. *Frontiers in Blockchain*, 7, 1443362. https://doi.org/10.3389/fbloc.2024.1443362\n- Ongoing research directions include:\n  - Enhancing privacy through anonymous credentials and zero-knowledge proofs.\n  - Improving scalability and user experience in SSI wallets.\n  - Addressing legal and regulatory frameworks for digital identity sovereignty.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK has seen significant SSI-related innovation, with government and private sector initiatives exploring decentralised identity for public services and financial sectors.\n- North England innovation hubs in Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield are increasingly active in blockchain and digital identity research, fostering startups and pilot projects utilising SSI principles.\n  - For example, Manchester’s blockchain clusters have supported SSI pilots in healthcare and education sectors, emphasising privacy and user control.\n- Regional case studies demonstrate practical SSI applications improving citizen access to services while reducing fraud and administrative overhead.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends:\n  - Integration of SSI with Internet of Things (IoT) devices and smart cities.\n  - Expansion of SSI use cases in healthcare, finance, and government identity verification.\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Balancing privacy with regulatory requirements such as KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering).\n  - Achieving interoperability across diverse SSI implementations and legacy systems.\n- Research priorities:\n  - Developing user-friendly SSI wallets with robust security.\n  - Establishing international standards and governance models.\n  - Investigating socio-technical impacts of decentralised identity on digital inclusion and trust.\n\n## References\n\n1.
