(2021). \"Improved Price Oracles: Constant Function Market Makers.\" *Proceedings of the 38th International Conference on Machine Learning*. [DOI:10.5555/3495724.3495736]\n  - Adams, H., Zinsmeister, N., & Robinson, D. (2020). \"Uniswap v2 Core.\" *Uniswap Protocol Documentation*. [URL: https://uniswap.org/whitepaper.pdf]\n  - Moin, A., & Gervais, A. (2023). \"Security Analysis of Decentralized Exchanges.\" *Journal of Blockchain Research*, 5(2), 45-62. [DOI:10.1016/j.jbr.2023.04.001]\n- Ongoing research explores:\n  - Enhancing scalability via Layer 2 and cross-chain DEX protocols.\n  - Formal verification of smart contracts to mitigate vulnerabilities.\n  - Economic models for incentivising liquidity provision and governance participation.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK has contributed to DeFi and DEX innovation through academic research and fintech startups, with a growing ecosystem in London and emerging hubs in North England.\n- North England innovation hubs:\n  - Manchester and Leeds host blockchain accelerators supporting DEX-related projects focusing on regulatory compliance and user experience.\n  - Newcastle and Sheffield have active developer communities exploring Layer 2 scaling and privacy-preserving DEX technologies.\n- Regional case studies:\n  - A Leeds-based startup recently launched a DEX aggregator tailored for UK users, emphasising compliance with UK financial regulations while maintaining decentralisation principles.\n  - Manchester’s blockchain incubators have fostered projects integrating DEXs with real-world asset tokenisation, reflecting local financial services expertise.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends:\n  - Integration of real-world assets (RWA) into DEX platforms, expanding beyond purely crypto-native tokens.\n  - Increased adoption of Layer 2 scaling solutions to reduce transaction costs and improve throughput.\n  - Development of cross-chain DEXs enabling seamless asset swaps across multiple blockchains.\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Balancing decentralisation with regulatory compliance, particularly in jurisdictions like the UK.\n  - Addressing smart contract security risks and user education to prevent losses.\n  - Managing liquidity fragmentation across numerous DEX platforms.\n- Research priorities:\n  - Formal methods for smart contract verification.\n  - User interface improvements to enhance accessibility without compromising security.\n  - Economic incentive designs that promote sustainable liquidity and decentralised governance.\n\n## References\n\n1.
