[URL]\n- Ongoing research explores adaptive regularisation, interpretability to detect overfitting patterns, and automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques to optimise model complexity.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK has made significant contributions to understanding and mitigating overfitting, with research centres such as the Alan Turing Institute in London and AI groups in North England universities.\n- Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield host innovation hubs applying machine learning in healthcare diagnostics and industrial automation, where overfitting detection and prevention are critical.\n- Regional case studies include Leeds’ work on predictive maintenance models for manufacturing, which incorporate robust cross-validation to avoid overfitting on limited sensor data.\n- The UK government’s AI strategy emphasises trustworthy AI, which includes addressing overfitting to ensure fairness and reliability.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include:\n  - Integration of causal inference methods to reduce reliance on spurious correlations that cause overfitting.\n  - Development of more sophisticated validation frameworks incorporating real-world data shifts.\n  - Use of synthetic data and federated learning to augment training datasets without compromising privacy.\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Balancing model complexity with interpretability, especially in regulated sectors.\n  - Managing overfitting in increasingly large and heterogeneous datasets.\n- Research priorities focus on automated detection of overfitting during training and creating models that adapt dynamically to new data distributions.\n\n## References\n\n1.
