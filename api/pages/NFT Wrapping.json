(2023). \"NFT Wrapping and Digital Asset Utility: A Survey.\" *Digital Economy Review*, 9(1), 34-50.\n- Ongoing research focuses on:\n  - Enhancing security and trust in custodial and non-custodial wrapping mechanisms.\n  - Developing standardised metadata schemas for wrapped NFTs.\n  - Exploring legal frameworks for wrapped NFT ownership and royalties.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- British contributions:\n  - UK-based blockchain research centres, including those at the University of Manchester and Newcastle University, contribute to interoperability protocols and smart contract security relevant to NFT wrapping.\n  - Legal scholarship in the UK is increasingly addressing the implications of wrapped NFTs for intellectual property and digital rights management.\n- North England innovation hubs:\n  - Manchester’s blockchain incubators support projects integrating NFT wrapping with digital art and music industries.\n  - Leeds fintech firms are piloting wrapped NFTs for secure digital identity and access control.\n  - Sheffield’s tech community explores wrapped NFTs in gaming and virtual event ticketing.\n- Regional case studies:\n  - A Leeds-based startup successfully implemented NFT wrapping to enable cross-platform digital collectibles interoperable between Ethereum and Polygon networks.\n  - Newcastle’s cultural sector has trialled wrapped NFTs to manage royalties and provenance for digital artworks exhibited online.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends:\n  - Increasing adoption of wrapped NFTs as utility tokens granting layered access rights, subscriptions, or exclusive content.\n  - Integration of wrapped NFTs with emerging Web3 identity and reputation systems.\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Achieving seamless cross-chain interoperability without compromising security or decentralisation.\n  - Legal and regulatory clarity on ownership rights and royalties in wrapped NFT contexts.\n- Research priorities:\n  - Developing universal standards for NFT wrapping metadata and smart contract interfaces.\n  - Enhancing user experience in managing wrapped NFTs across multiple platforms.\n  - Investigating decentralised custodial models to reduce reliance on trusted intermediaries.\n\n## References\n\n1.
