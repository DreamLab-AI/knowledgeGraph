This mechanism emerged as protocols recognised that most token holders lack time, expertise, or interest to evaluate every governance proposal, yet their participation remains crucial for legitimate decision-making. Delegation systems, pioneered by [[Compound]]'s delegate() function and adopted by [[Uniswap]], [[ENS]], [[Gitcoin]], [[Optimism]], and dozens more protocols, enable passive token holders to assign voting power to active participants who research proposals, participate in discussions, and cast informed votes. The model has proven remarkably successful: [[ENS]] governance operates with 400+ active delegates managing billions in voting power, [[Optimism]]'s Token House features 100+ delegates directing protocol development, whilst [[Gitcoin]] and [[Uniswap]] each maintain robust delegate ecosystems managing multi-billion dollar treasuries. Professional delegate services emerged including [[StableLab]], [[Boardroom]], [[Stanford Blockchain Club]], and [[Flipside Crypto]], offering institutional-grade governance participation. Dedicated platforms like [[Karma]] and [[Agora]] provide delegate discovery, reputation tracking, voting record transparency, and communication channels between delegates and delegators. Delegation fundamentally transforms governance participation economics: rather than requiring millions of token holders to individually evaluate proposals, protocols can achieve informed decision-making through hundreds of compensated, accountable delegates. This creates viable career paths in DAO governance, professionalises decision-making, and increases effective participation rates from single-digit percentages to majority participation through delegation. However, delegation introduces new challenges including voting power concentration (top delegates often control 20-40% of voting power), principal-agent problems between delegates and delegators, capture risks where special interests influence delegates, and accountability mechanisms ensuring delegates serve delegator interests. Leading protocols address these through delegate compensation programmes, transparent voting records, periodic re-delegation, delegate platforms facilitating communication, and bicameral systems like [[Optimism]]'s separation of token-based and reputation-based houses. The evolution of delegate democracy demonstrates how DAOs can adapt representative governance traditions to decentralised contexts, creating hybrid systems that balance direct democracy ideals with practical governance effectiveness.\n\t-\n\t- ### Delegation Mechanics and Infrastructure\n\t\t- **Compound's Delegate System**: [[Compound]] pioneered on-chain delegation through the delegate() function in COMP token contract, enabling gasless delegation via ERC-712 signatures (delegateBySig()). The system implements checkpoint-based voting power tracking where each delegation creates checkpoints recording voting power at specific blocks, enabling historical power calculation for proposal voting. Delegators retain token ownership and transfer rights whilst delegates receive voting power, creating clean separation between economic and governance rights. Compound's delegation is atomic (all-or-nothing rather than proportional), persistent (remains until explicitly changed), and requires no ongoing gas costs once set. The architecture became standard for governance tokens, implemented through OpenZeppelin's ERC20Votes extension adopted by dozens of protocols. Compound governance data shows approximately 70% of circulating COMP is delegated, with top 10 delegates controlling over 50% of total voting power, demonstrating both success and concentration challenges.\n\t\t- **Multi-Delegatee Systems**: Advanced delegation schemes enable splitting voting power across multiple delegates or topics. [[Gitcoin]]'s delegation allows partial delegation (delegate X% of holdings to delegate A, Y% to delegate B), enabling diversification and specialisation. Topic-based delegation proposals suggest delegating different protocol areas to relevant experts (treasury decisions to finance specialists, technical upgrades to developers, community initiatives to governance professionals), though implementation remains limited. These sophisticated schemes promise better principal-agent alignment but introduce complexity potentially deterring participation.\n\t\t- **Liquid Democracy**: Some protocols experiment with transitive delegation where delegates can re-delegate received power, creating delegation chains. This enables emergent specialist hierarchies where generalists delegate to domain experts who delegate specific topics to specialists. However, complexity and accountability challenges have limited adoption, with most protocols preferring single-hop delegation maintaining clearer responsibility chains.\n\t\t- **Delegation Platforms**: [[Karma]] and [[Agora]] provide delegate discovery and management infrastructure. Karma serves [[Optimism]], [[Gitcoin]], [[Arbitrum]], and other protocols, offering delegate dashboards showing voting history, participation rates, communication activity, and delegator counts. The platform enables delegates to create profiles, publish platforms outlining their governance philosophy, and communicate with delegators. Agora serves [[ENS]], [[Uniswap]], and [[Nouns]], providing similar functionality with enhanced discussion features and proposal tracking. These platforms dramatically reduce friction in finding and evaluating delegates, addressing information asymmetry challenges.\n\t-\n\t- ### ENS Delegate Ecosystem\n\t\t- **Scale and Structure**: [[ENS]] operates one of crypto's most developed delegate ecosystems with 400+ active delegates managing governance of the .eth namespace and $300+ million treasury. The protocol distributed 25% of total ENS token supply to .eth name holders in November 2021, creating instant governance community of 137,000+ token holders. Within six months, over 50% of circulating supply was delegated, demonstrating strong delegation adoption. The top 50 delegates control approximately 60% of voting power, whilst the top 10 control roughly 30%, showing significant concentration but more distributed than many protocols.\n\t\t- **Steward Programme**: ENS pioneered structured delegate compensation through Steward roles where highly engaged delegates receive defined responsibilities and compensation (initially $5,000 monthly stipend, later adjusted). Stewards commit to reviewing all proposals, participating in discussions, maintaining communication with delegators, and producing regular reports. The programme created professional delegate class incentivised for consistent, high-quality participation. As of 2024, ENS maintains approximately 10-15 funded Steward positions selected through governance votes, establishing governance professionals as recognised DAO role.\n\t\t- **Working Groups**: ENS governance operates through working groups (Ecosystem, Public Goods, Meta-Governance, Community) where active delegates and contributors coordinate on specific domains. Working groups receive budget allocations from main DAO, operate with delegated authority for domain decisions, and report regularly to broader governance. This structure enables specialist focus whilst maintaining democratic oversight, demonstrating effective governance subdivision.\n\t\t- **Delegate Diversity**: ENS delegates range from individual community members to professional services ([[StableLab]], [[Boardroom]]), from technical contributors to governance specialists, and from pseudonymous participants to public figures. This diversity provides multiple governance perspectives whilst creating varied delegation options for token holders with different priorities and values.\n\t-\n\t- ### Optimism's Bicameral Governance\n\t\t- **Token House**: [[Optimism]]'s Token House represents OP token holders through delegated governance, controlling protocol upgrades, network parameters, and treasury allocations. The house features 100+ active delegates including individuals, organisations ([[StableLab]], [[L2BEAT]], [[GFX Labs]]), and protocol teams. Token House delegates vote on proposals affecting technical infrastructure, ecosystem incentives, and governance processes. The system tracks delegate participation rates, voting alignment, and communication quality through [[Karma]] platform integration.\n\t\t- **Citizens' House**: Optimism introduced the Citizens' House as reputation-based governance body distributing RetroPGF (Retroactive Public Goods Funding) rewards. Unlike token-based Token House, Citizens' House membership derives from soulbound Citizen NFTs distributed to addresses demonstrating positive ecosystem contribution. This creates bicameral system balancing token-weighted economic interests (Token House) with merit-based community representation (Citizens' House). Citizens' House conducts RetroPGF rounds allocating millions to ecosystem contributors based on retroactive impact assessment rather than prospective grants.\n\t\t- **Separation of Powers**: The bicameral design addresses token plutocracy concerns by reserving certain decisions for reputation-based Citizens whilst maintaining token holder control over economic and technical matters. This separation mirrors traditional political structures whilst innovating on membership selection and voting mechanisms. Early rounds distributed over $30 million through Citizens' House, demonstrating substantial resource allocation through non-token mechanisms.\n\t\t- **Delegate Incentives**: Optimism compensates top delegates through season-based rewards, with Season 3 allocating 850,000 OP (approximately $1.5 million at distribution) to 90 delegates based on participation metrics. This creates sustainable delegate compensation model funded by protocol inflation, addressing long-term delegate retention challenges.\n\t-\n\t- ### Professional Delegate Services\n\t\t- **StableLab**: [[StableLab]] operates as professional governance service provider, participating as delegate across [[Optimism]], [[Arbitrum]], [[Uniswap]], [[Hop Protocol]], [[Polygon]], and 15+ additional protocols. The firm publishes detailed voting rationales, maintains high participation rates (typically 95%+ of proposals), produces governance analytics, and engages in pre-proposal discussions. StableLab's team includes governance specialists, researchers, and protocol experts providing institutional-grade participation. The firm monetises through protocol grants, delegate compensation programmes, and consulting services whilst building reputation as reliable, informed participant.\n\t\t- **Boardroom**: [[Boardroom]] combines delegate services with governance infrastructure, serving as delegate across major protocols whilst providing governance aggregation platform. The firm's delegates participate in [[Compound]], [[Aave]], [[Gitcoin]], [[ENS]], and other ecosystems, whilst Boardroom's platform tracks governance across 100+ protocols. This vertical integration positions Boardroom as governance infrastructure provider and participant, creating potential synergies and conflicts of interest requiring transparency.\n\t\t- **Stanford Blockchain Club**: [[Stanford Blockchain Club]] operates as university-affiliated delegate, bringing academic perspectives to protocol governance. The organisation participates in [[Uniswap]], [[Compound]], [[Gitcoin]], and other protocols, publishing research-backed voting rationales and governance analyses. University delegates introduce educational components, creating pipeline for future governance professionals whilst providing informed, mission-aligned participation.\n\t\t- **Flipside Crypto**: [[Flipside Crypto]] leverages its blockchain analytics expertise in delegate activities, providing data-driven voting rationales and governance dashboards. The firm participates across multiple protocols, combining analytics products with governance services to create differentiated delegate positioning emphasising empirical decision-making.\n\t-\n\t- ### Gitcoin Delegate Programme\n\t\t- **Structure and Scale**: [[Gitcoin]] maintains robust delegate programme with 200+ delegates managing governance of $100+ million treasury and Gitcoin Grants operations. The protocol implemented delegation following GTC token launch in 2021, rapidly achieving over 60% supply delegation. Gitcoin's governance covers grants funding, protocol parameters, community initiatives, and treasury management, requiring sustained delegate engagement across diverse topics.\n\t\t- **Workstream Delegates**: Gitcoin pioneered workstream-specific delegation where delegates can specialise in particular governance areas (Public Goods Funding, Product Development, DAO Operations). This enables expertise-based delegation whilst avoiding overwhelming delegates with all governance decisions. Workstreams operate with delegated budgets and authority, reporting to main DAO through regular updates and accountability mechanisms.\n\t\t- **Steward Rewards**: Gitcoin implemented quarterly Steward rewards distributing GTC to top delegates based on participation metrics, discussion quality, and delegator feedback. Season-based rewards (100,000 GTC per quarter, approximately $150,000) compensate 20-30 top stewards, creating professional delegate tier. This programme balance compensation (incentivising participation) with performance measurement (rewarding quality over mere presence).\n\t\t- **Delegate Communication**: Gitcoin emphasises delegate-delegator communication through forum posts, Twitter threads, and Delegate Corner discussions where delegates explain positions and receive community feedback. This accountability mechanism addresses principal-agent concerns by maintaining transparency and enabling delegator switching if dissatisfied with delegate performance.\n\t-\n\t- ### Uniswap Delegate Landscape\n\t\t- **High-Value Delegation**: [[Uniswap]]'s $3.5+ billion treasury makes delegate decisions extraordinarily high-stakes, attracting sophisticated delegate participants including venture firms ([[a16z]], [[Paradigm]]), DeFi protocols ([[Aave]], [[Compound]]), and professional delegates ([[StableLab]], [[GFX Labs]]). The top 10 delegates control over 60% of voting power, with a16z alone controlling approximately 15-20% through delegations, creating significant concentration and influence concerns.\n\t\t- **Delegate Diversity Initiatives**: Recognising concentration risks, Uniswap governance funded delegate diversity programmes encouraging smaller delegators and underrepresented perspectives. The Delegate Reward Initiative (DRI) compensated active delegates based on participation, whilst educational programmes lowered barriers to delegate participation. However, structural factors (large holders preferring established delegates, delegation inertia) maintain high concentration.\n\t\t- **Controversy and Accountability**: Uniswap delegates face public scrutiny on major decisions: the $74 million Uniswap Grants Program saw extensive delegate debate, the Uniswap v3 licence controversy generated months of discussion, and proposals to deploy on new chains created delegate divisions. This public accountability through governance forums, Twitter debates, and delegate reports creates strong transparency incentives whilst potentially creating groupthink pressures.\n\t\t- **Institutional Delegates**: Major stakeholders like [[a16z crypto]], [[Andreessen Horowitz]], and [[Paradigm]] operate institutional delegate programmes with dedicated staff, research resources, and formal voting processes. These well-resourced delegates provide informed participation but raise concerns about venture capital influence over ostensibly decentralised protocols.\n\t-\n\t- ### Delegation Platforms and Infrastructure\n\t\t- **Karma Dashboard**: [[Karma]] provides comprehensive delegate analytics tracking voting participation, proposal outcomes aligned with community, discussion engagement, and delegator growth. The platform serves [[Optimism]], [[Gitcoin]], [[Arbitrum]], [[Compound]], and other protocols, establishing itself as standard delegate transparency infrastructure. Karma's delegate scores combine multiple metrics creating reputation signals, whilst delegate profiles provide platforms, voting histories, and communication channels. The platform enables delegators to make informed decisions based on quantitative participation data and qualitative delegate positioning.\n\t\t- **Agora**: [[Agora]] offers enhanced discussion features alongside delegate tracking, serving [[ENS]], [[Uniswap]], and [[Nouns]]. The platform integrates proposal discussions, delegate statements, voting interfaces, and outcome tracking in unified experience. Agora emphasises deliberation quality through structured discussion formats, delegate office hours, and town hall integrations. The platform's funding through protocol grants demonstrates DAO investment in governance infrastructure.\n\t\t- **Tally Delegation**: [[Tally]] integrates delegation management directly into proposal voting interfaces, enabling one-click delegation whilst viewing proposals. The platform serves 100+ protocols, providing standardised delegation UX across diverse governance systems. Tally's analytics track delegation concentration, delegate activity, and power distribution, providing transparency into governance centralisation risks.\n\t\t- **Snapshot Delegation**: [[Snapshot]] supports delegation through delegation strategies where voting power calculation includes delegated tokens. The platform's flexibility enables custom delegation schemes, multi-delegatee systems, and weighted delegation, though most protocols implement simple single-delegate models for clarity.\n\t-\n\t- ### Compensation Models\n\t\t- **Direct Stipends**: [[ENS]] Stewards receive fixed monthly compensation ($5,000-$10,000 depending on role and season) creating predictable income for professional delegates. This model enables full-time governance participation but requires subjective selection of compensated delegates through governance votes.\n\t\t- **Performance-Based Rewards**: [[Optimism]] and [[Gitcoin]] distribute rewards based on quantitative metrics (participation rates, proposal counts, discussion engagement) creating objective compensation criteria. [[Optimism]]'s delegate rewards allocated 850,000 OP across 90 delegates in Season 3, with distribution proportional to activity scores. This incentivises measured behaviours but risks gamification and may not capture qualitative contribution quality.\n\t\t- **Retroactive Rewards**: [[Arbitrum]] and other protocols experiment with retroactive delegate compensation evaluating performance after completion rather than committing upfront. This addresses moral hazard concerns whilst creating uncertainty for delegates planning professional involvement.\n\t\t- **Protocol Grants**: Delegates often receive one-time or recurring grants from DAOs valuing their participation. [[StableLab]] received grants from multiple protocols supporting their multi-protocol governance participation. This ad-hoc approach enables flexible compensation but lacks systematic structure supporting sustainable delegate professions.\n\t-\n\t- ### Voting Power Concentration\n\t\t- **Top-Heavy Distribution**: Across major protocols, top 10 delegates typically control 40-70% of voting power: [[Compound]] (50%+), [[Uniswap]] (60%+), [[Gitcoin]] (45%+), [[Optimism]] (55%+). This concentration creates efficiency (small groups can achieve quorum) but risks capture, groupthink, and perceived illegitimacy.\n\t\t- **Whale Delegates**: Individual large holders often self-delegate rather than delegating to others, maintaining direct control. [[a16z]]'s Uniswap holdings, [[Dragonfly]]'s Compound position, and treasury holdings of major protocols create single delegates with 10-20% voting power, exceeding entire delegate cohorts.\n\t\t- **Concentration Metrics**: Governance analytics track Gini coefficients, Nakamoto coefficients (minimum delegates needed for majority), and participation concentration to quantify centralisation. [[Gitcoin]]'s Nakamoto coefficient of approximately 7 (seven delegates control majority) demonstrates high concentration despite 200+ total delegates.\n\t\t- **Mitigation Strategies**: Protocols address concentration through quadratic voting experiments, delegation caps (proposed but rarely implemented), diverse delegate recruitment, and educational programmes encouraging broader delegation. However, structural factors (large holders preferring established delegates, delegation inertia, network effects favouring known delegates) make meaningful distribution challenging.\n\t-\n\t- ### Accountability Mechanisms\n\t\t- **Transparent Voting Records**: All delegate votes record on-chain or via Snapshot, creating permanent public records. Platforms like [[Karma]], [[Agora]], and [[Boardroom]] surface this data, enabling delegator evaluation of delegate performance relative to stated positions.\n\t\t- **Regular Reporting**: Many delegates voluntarily publish voting rationales, monthly reports, and governance analyses explaining decisions. [[StableLab]] maintains blog with detailed voting explanations, [[Gauntlet]] publishes data-driven recommendations, and [[GFX Labs]] produces extensive governance research. This transparency enables delegator assessment whilst creating accountability through public scrutiny.\n\t\t- **Delegator Communication**: Leading delegates maintain active presence on governance forums, Discord channels, and Twitter, engaging directly with delegators and broader community. This accessibility enables real-time feedback, concerns escalation, and relationship building between delegates and constituents.\n\t\t- **Re-delegation Rights**: Delegators can instantly re-delegate to different delegates if dissatisfied, creating market discipline. However, delegation inertia (most delegations remain indefinitely unless actively changed) and re-delegation costs (gas fees, information search) limit practical accountability through threat of delegation removal.\n\t-\n\t- ### Challenges and Criticisms\n\t\t- **Principal-Agent Problems**: Delegates may pursue interests diverging from delegators due to different incentives, information asymmetries, or capture by special interests. Delegates compensated by protocols may favour protocol teams over token holders, delegates with large holdings may vote self-interest over community benefit, and delegates receiving side payments may compromise independence.\n\t\t- **Voter Apathy Transfer**: Rather than solving low participation through better engagement, delegation may simply transfer apathy from token holders to delegate selection, with most delegations occurring once and never reconsidered. Studies show 80%+ of delegations remain unchanged for years despite changing delegate performance or positions.\n\t\t- **Echo Chambers**: Professional delegates forming cohesive community may develop groupthink, shared blind spots, or insider dynamics excluding dissenting views. Public delegate discussions may create social pressure toward consensus positions even when disagreement would be valuable.\n\t\t- **Capture Risks**: Well-resourced special interests can influence delegates through various mechanisms: offering delegate compensation, providing research supporting particular positions, or informal relationship building. The professionalization of delegation creates surfaces for sophisticated influence campaigns.\n\t-\n\t- ### Case Studies and Outcomes\n\t\t- **ENS Constitution**: ENS delegates approved the ENS Constitution establishing protocol values and governance principles through overwhelming consensus (97% support). This demonstrated delegate coordination on foundational governance documents whilst the high alignment suggested possible groupthink or insufficient critical perspectives.\n\t\t- **Uniswap Deployment Votes**: Uniswap delegates debated and approved deployments to [[BNB Chain]], [[Polygon]], and other networks through delegate-led discussions weighing network alignment, security considerations, and ecosystem growth. These technical-economic decisions demonstrated delegate capacity for nuanced evaluation beyond simple yes/no positions.\n\t\t- **Gitcoin Grants Changes**: Gitcoin delegates restructured the grants programme multiple times, experimenting with different funding mechanisms, eligibility criteria, and programme designs. This iterative governance demonstrates delegate willingness to adjust failed approaches whilst maintaining programme continuity.\n\t\t- **Compound Treasury Management**: Compound delegates approved treasury diversification, yield strategies, and investment decisions managing hundreds of millions. The technical and financial complexity of these proposals demonstrated delegate capacity for sophisticated decision-making whilst highlighting information asymmetries between expert and non-expert delegates.\n\t-\n\t- ### Emerging Innovations\n\t\t- **Specialised Delegation**: Proposals for topic-specific or workstream-specific delegation enable delegators to assign different experts to different domains: technical delegates for protocol upgrades, financial delegates for treasury decisions, community delegates for grants and ecosystem initiatives. Implementation complexity has limited adoption but sophistication continues developing.\n\t\t- **Conviction Voting**: Some protocols experiment with conviction voting where voting power accumulates over time based on vote strength and duration, rewarding long-term stake and commitment. This may complement delegation by better weighting passionate informed minorities against apathetic majorities.\n\t\t- **Delegate Rotation**: [[Nouns DAO]] and others experiment with time-limited delegate terms requiring periodic reselection. This creates regular evaluation points whilst potentially destabilising through constant delegate turnover.\n\t\t- **Futarchy and Delegation**: Theoretical work explores combining delegation with prediction markets or futarchy where delegates set values whilst markets determine facts, potentially improving decision quality through mechanism diversity.\n\t-\n\t- ### Cross-Protocol Delegate Activity\n\t\t- **Multi-Protocol Delegates**: Professional delegates typically participate across 5-15 protocols simultaneously, creating economies of scale in governance infrastructure, research, and attention. [[StableLab]] delegates across 15+ protocols, [[Boardroom]] across 10+, enabling specialised governance careers impossible within single protocol.\n\t\t- **Cross-Protocol Learning**: Delegates transfer governance innovations across protocols: [[ENS]]'s steward model influenced [[Gitcoin]], [[Optimism]]'s bicameral structure inspired other L2s, [[Compound]]'s technical governance patterns spread to forks and derivatives. This cross-pollination accelerates governance evolution.\n\t\t- **Coordination Challenges**: Multi-protocol delegation creates time constraints and potential conflicts: delegates voting on cross-protocol proposals (one DAO's grant to delegate's other DAO) must manage conflicts of interest, whilst simultaneous proposal timing creates attention competition.\n\t\t- **Ecosystem Governance**: Some delegates specialise in particular ecosystems ([[Cosmos]] ecosystem delegates, [[Ethereum]] which refers to A component of the metaverse ecosystem focusing on ethereum. L2 delegates, DeFi protocol delegates) developing domain expertise whilst managing related protocols' governance.\n\t-\n\t- ### Future Directions\n\t\t- **Delegation Analytics**: Improving quantitative measurement of delegate quality beyond simple participation rates: voting alignment with community sentiment, proposal outcome prediction accuracy, delegator retention rates, and contribution quality assessments.\n\t\t- **Onchain Reputation**: Development of onchain reputation systems aggregating governance participation, proposal outcomes, and community feedback into composable reputation tokens or soulbound credentials enabling reputation-weighted governance experiments.\n\t\t- **Delegate DAOs**: Experiments with delegate organisations where groups form DAOs to jointly serve as delegate, internally deliberating before casting unified votes. This creates accountability structures within delegate organisations whilst potentially adding coordination overhead.\n\t\t- **AI-Assisted Delegation**: Emerging tools use AI to summarise proposals, analyse voting records, and match delegator preferences to delegate positions, reducing information costs in delegate selection and ongoing monitoring.\n\t-\n\t- #\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable\n\n\n## References and Resources\n\t\t- [[BC-0410-decentralised-autonomous-organisations]]\n\t\t- [[BC-0411-dao-governance-models]]\n\t\t- [[BC-0469-governance-tokens]]\n\t\t- [[BC-0470-voting-mechanisms]]\n\t\t- [[BC-0471-tokenomics-governance]] which refers to A component of the blockchain ecosystem.\n\t\t- [[BC-0472-dao-tooling]] which refers to A component of the blockchain ecosystem.\n\t\t- [[BC-0474-grant-programs]] which refers to A component of the blockchain ecosystem.\n\t\t- [[BC-0462-treasury-management]]\n\t\t- [[Compound]]\n\t\t- [[Uniswap]]\n\t\t- [[ENS]]\n\t\t- [[Optimism]]\n\t\t- [[Gitcoin]]\n\t\t- [[Karma]]\n\t\t- [[Agora]]\n\t\t- [[StableLab]]\n\t-\n\t- ### Original Content\n\t  collapsed:: true\n\t\t- ```\n\n\t\t  ```",
