These incredibly profitable stacks are the product of surveillance capitalism. They didn't make these for the public good, they made them for profit, and these products entrench the surveillance capitalism abuse.\n\npublic:: true\n\n\npublic:: true\n\n\n#Public page automatically published\n\n\npublic:: true\n\n\n\t\t\t- ### Accuracy Concerns\n\t\t\t- The reliability and accuracy of AI surveillance systems are critical issues:\n\t\t\t\t- **Lack of Public Data:** There is limited publicly available information on the accuracy and reliability of these systems. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to assess their effectiveness.\n\t\t\t\t- **Historical Bias:** Historical data indicates that facial recognition systems and other AI technologies are less accurate for individuals with darker skin tones. This bias can lead to misidentification and wrongful surveillance of certain demographic groups.\n\npublic:: true\n\n- The software is free and open source here:\n\t- [DreamLab-AI/VisionFlow: Logseq Spring Thing Immersive & Agentic Knowledge Development Engine](https://github.com/DreamLab-AI/VisionFlow)\n- More in depth overview [[VisionFlow and Junkie Jarvis]]\n-\n\npublic:: true\n\n\npublic:: true\n\n\n\t- ### Public Perception: Divergent Views Across Regions\n\t\t- In emerging economies like China, Indonesia, and Thailand, a significant majority view AI as more beneficial than harmful, with 83%, 80%, and 77% respectively expressing optimism.\n\t\t- Conversely, in the United States, only 39% share this positive outlook, reflecting a more cautious or skeptical stance towards AI's impact.\n\n\t- ## Institutional and Government Adoption\n\t- Bitcoin ownership is also growing among public companies, funds, and even governments:\n\t\t- Public companies hold 1.8% of the total Bitcoin supply (354,300 BTC)\n\t\t- Funds control 5.5% of the supply (1,079,000 BTC)\n\t\t- Governments hold an estimated 2.5% of the supply, with the US, China, and UK being the largest holders\n\t\t- [link](https://uk.marketscreener.com/news/latest/Global-Crypto-Adoption-On-The-Rise-Key-2024-Trends-47893848/)\n\t\t- Notably, Bhutan was recently discovered to hold 13,036 BTC, valued at approximately $780 million -

They are increasingly capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, including understanding and generating language, making decisions, solving complex problems, and learning from data. They can theoretically make informed decisions or recommendations. They have the potential to revolutionise various industries, improving efficiency and productivity in numerous domains, code writing being the main one.\n\t- Agents potentially disrupt busywork, mid/high end technology jobs, and management roles.

We might consider the potential impacts and the narrative that could unfold. This situation would essentially create \"paper Bitcoin,\" similar to what has occurred in other commodity markets, where the traded instruments represent the asset but don't necessarily entail ownership of the physical commodity.\n\npublic:: true\n\n- #Public page\n\t - automatically published\n\npublic:: true\n\n- #Public page automatically published\n\n\t- ##  El Salvador\n\t\t- El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. El Salvador's adoption of Bitcoin was a historic moment in the world of Bitcoin and was met with a mix of excitement and scepticism. On June 9, 2021, the country's Legislative Assembly approved a bill introduced by President Nayib Bukele to make Bitcoin a legal tender alongside the US dollar, which has been used as the country's official currency since 2001.\n\t\t- President Bukele, who has been a vocal proponent of Bitcoin, stated that the adoption of Bitcoin was a way to promote financial inclusion and stability in the country, where more than 70% of the population is unbanked or underbanked. In a tweet, he stated, \"Bitcoin will have the same value as the US dollar. We will support both. They will have the same power of purchase and will be accepted in the same way.\"\n\t\t- The move was met with a lot of media attention and reaction, with some praising it as a bold and innovative step, while others raised concerns about the volatility of Bitcoin and their potential impact on the economy. President Nayib Bukele himself has faced criticism for his handling of political power and some of his actions have raised concerns about the potential for abuses of power. In 2021, President Bukele faced widespread criticism for his handling of the legislative process and his use of the military to secure the Legislative Assembly building during a political standoff with lawmakers. This led to allegations of intimidation and a violation of democratic norms, and raised concerns about his willingness to use force to achieve his political goals. Additionally, President Bukele has faced criticism for his use of social media to communicate with the public and his tendency to bypass traditional media outlets, which has raised concerns about the potential for censorship and the manipulation of information. With that said he seems much loved in the country, and the previously appalling safety statistics of the nation have radically improved.\n\t\t- In addition to the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender, El Salvador has also proposed the issuance of a Bitcoin-backed bond to finance various public works projects and promote the use of Bitcoin. The bond would be denominated in Bitcoin and would allow investors to directly participate in the country's development while also supporting the growth and adoption of Bitcoin.\n\t\t- Another ambitious project that has been proposed by President Bukele and his administration is the creation of \"Bitcoin City\", a new city that would mine Bitcoin at the base of a dormant Volcano, and offer considerable tax benefits to holders. The city would serve as a hub for innovation and a showcase for the potential of Bitcoin, and would offer a wide range of services, including housing, healthcare, education, and entertainment.\n\t\t- There has been a significant increase in the adoption of Bitcoin in El Salvador (to around 12%) and apparently increased inward investment to the country. Many businesses, both small and large, have started accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment, and there has been a growing interest in Bitcoin among the general population. Additionally, the government has been actively promoting the use of Bitcoin through various initiatives. There have also been efforts to educate the public about Bitcoin and its potential benefits, including increased financial security and reduced transaction fees compared to traditional banking systems.\n\t\t- Overall, the adoption of Bitcoin in El Salvador has been positive, far outstripping the number of people in the country with traditional bank accounts, and has the potential to greatly impact the country's economy and financial sector. However, it is important to note that there are still challenges to overcome, such as regulatory and infrastructure limitations, as well as ongoing concerns about the volatility and stability of Bitcoin.\n\t\t- Somewhat surprisingly the IMF have de-escalated their previously highly critical assessment of the move, toward a more [concerned and conciliatory tone](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/02/10/el-salvador-staff-concluding-statement-of-the-2023-article-iv-mission): [\"Bitcoin's risks should be addressed. While risks have not materialized due to the limited Bitcoin use so far---as suggested by survey and remittances data---its use could grow given its legal tender status and new legislative reforms to encourage the use of crypto assets, including tokenized bonds (Digital Assets Law). In this context, underlying risks to financial integrity and stability, fiscal sustainability, and consumer protection persist, and the recommendations of the 2021 Article IV remain valid. Greater transparency over the government's transactions in Bitcoin and the financial situation of the state-owned Bitcoin-wallet (Chivo) remains essential, especially to assess the underlying fiscal contingencies and counterparty risks.\"]\n\t\t- In terms of economic impact, it is still too early to determine the full effects of the adoption of Bitcoin in El Salvador. However, it is expected to have a positive impact on financial inclusion and stability, as well as reducing the reliance on traditional banking systems. The use of Bitcoin has the potential to lower transaction fees and increase financial security, which could be particularly beneficial for those who do not have access to traditional banking services.\n\t\t- Overall, the adoption of Bitcoin in El Salvador marks a significant step forward in the mainstream acceptance and adoption of Bitcoin and has the potential to set a precedent for other countries to follow. However, it is important to monitor the situation and assess the long-term impacts on the economy and financial sector.\n\t\t- Their official Bitcoin page shows the accumulation.\n\t\t\t- <iframe src=\"https://bitcoin.gob.sv/\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 600px\"></iframe>\n\n\t- ### Argentina's Economic Situation\n\t- **Inflation Surge**: Argentina's inflation rate hit 100%, the highest since 1991.\n\t- **Impact on Currency**: The Argentine peso's value is rapidly declining.\n\t- **Government Statistics**: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 13.1% since the year's start, but the government's data reliability is questioned.\n\t- **Public Struggle**: Citizens like Irene DeVita express the hardships faced due to the collapsing currency.\n\npublic:: true\n\n- Public page automatically published\n\npublic:: true\n\n\npublic:: true\n\n- #Public page automatically published\n\n\t- #### Machine to machine communication\n\t\t- It is likely best considered as a pivotal enabling technology strand which compliments [[Public Key Encryption]] infrastructure.

This has come pretty much out of nowhere but seems highlyrelevant to us if it sticks. From the text: Here is the bullet pointlist in LaTeX:\n-\n\t- **Empowering people and reinforcing skills** to foster awareness, access to trustworthy information and build a talent pool of virtual world specialists. By the end of 2023, the Commission will promote the guiding principles for virtual worlds, put forward by the Citizens’ Panel; and will develop guidance for the general public thanks to a ‘Citizen toolbox’ by the first quarter of 2024. As specialists on virtual worlds are essential, the Commission will work with Member States to set up a talent pipeline and will support skills development, including for women and girls, through projects funded by the Digital Europe Programme, and for creators of digital content through the Creative Europe programme.\n-\n\t- **Business: supporting a European Web 4.0 industrial ecosystem** to scale up excellence and address fragmentation. Currently, there is no EU ecosystem bringing together the different players of the value chain of virtual worlds and Web 4.0. The Commission has proposed a candidate Partnership on Virtual Worlds under Horizon Europe, possibly starting 2025, to foster excellence in research and develop an industrial and technological roadmap for virtual worlds. To foster innovation, the Commission will also support EU creators and media companies to test new creation tools, bring together developers and industrial users, and work with Member States to develop regulatory sandboxes for Web 4.0 and virtual worlds.\n-\n\t- **Government: supporting societal progress and virtual public services** to leverage the opportunities virtual worlds can offer. The EU is already investing in major initiatives, such as Destination Earth (DestinE), Local Digital Twins for smart communities, or the European Digital Twin of the Ocean to allow researchers to advance science, industries to develop precision applications and public authorities to make informed public-policy decisions. The Commission is launching two new public flagships: “CitiVerse”, an immersive urban environment that can be used for city planning and management; and a European Virtual Human Twin, which will replicate the human body to support clinical decisions and personal treatment.\n-\n\t- **Shaping global standards for open and interoperable virtual worlds and Web 4.0,** ensuring that they will not be dominated by a few big players. The Commission will engage with internet governance stakeholders around the world and will promote Web 4.0 standards in line with the EU’s vision and values.\n-\n\npublic:: true\n\n\npublic:: true\n\n- ![WhatsApp Image 2024-06-13 at 09.29.51_1881330c.jpg](assets/WhatsApp_Image_2024-06-13_at_09.29.51_1881330c_1718268091114_0.jpg){:width 400}\n\t- [Deepfake Video Call Scams Finance Bro Out of $25 Million (gizmodo.com)](https://gizmodo.com/deepfake-video-call-scams-finance-bro-out-25-million-1851227196)\n- [FCC-24-17A1.pdf](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-24-17A1.pdf) FCC makes robotcalls illegal after New Hampshire political stunt [Fake Biden robocall investigation targets 2 Texas companies | AP News](https://apnews.com/article/biden-robocalls-artificial-intelligence-new-hampshire-texas-a8665277d43d05380d2c7594edf27617)\n- [Bland AI Phone Calling Platform](https://www.bland.ai/) [[Cyber security and Cryptography]] [[Agents]]\n- [Viral deepfake videos of Le Pen family reminder that content moderation is still not up to par ahead of EU elections – Euractiv](https://www.euractiv.com/section/artificial-intelligence/news/viral-deepfake-videos-of-le-pen-family-reminder-that-content-moderation-is-still-not-up-to-par-ahead-of-eu-elections/)\n- [twitter link to the render loading below](https://twitter.com/BrivaelLp/status/1772023234512175290)\n- {{twitter https://twitter.com/BrivaelLp/status/1772023234512175290}}\n\npublic:: true\n\n\npublic:: true\n\n- #Public page\n\t- automatically published\n\npublic:: true\n\n- #Public page\n\t - automatically published\n- PatchFusion [zhyever/PatchFusion: An End-to-End Tile-Based Framework for High-Resolution Monocular Metric Depth Estimation (github.com)](https://github.com/zhyever/PatchFusion)\n  title:: Depth Estimation\n- Marigold, [prs-eth/Marigold: Marigold: Repurposing Diffusion-Based Image Generators for Monocular Depth Estimation (github.com)](https://github.com/prs-eth/Marigold)\n- DMD-Mix, [[2312.13252v1] Zero-Shot Metric Depth with a Field-of-View Conditioned Diffusion Model (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13252v1)\n- ZoeDepth.

One of these was the previously discussed Swift international settlement network. Another whole category was the removal of support by private businesses domiciled outside of Russia and Ukraine, and pertinent here is that VISA, Mastercard, Paypal, and Western Union all removed support for their product rails. This means that while some cards and services still work, and will likely work again through Chinese proxies in the coming months, considerable disruption will be felt by Russian companies and individuals. This is not to say that this disruption is necessarily wrong, but it is clear now that all of these global financial transfer products and services are contingent on political factors. The same might be true of CBDC products if they gain traction globally. There is certainly no reason why all money within a physically delineated border could not be blocked or cancelled. This is not as true for Bitcoin at this time.\n\t\t\t- However, with enough political will it is technically plausible to incentivise miners with additional payments to exclude transactions from geolocated wallets. This would be mitigated by Tor, and in a global anonymous network it is very likely that a miner could be found at a higher price for inclusion in the next block.\n\t\t\t- We have already seen much negative political positioning related to the energy concerns in an earlier chapter. There are similar noises coming from policy makers with regard to the money utility of the technology. The United Nations [have made the following recommendations](https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/presspb2022d8_en.pdf):\n\t\t\t\t- “Developing countries may have less room to manoeuvre, yet the regulation of cryptocurrencies is possible. The following policies, among others, have the potential to curb the further spread of the risks of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins:\n\t\t\t\t\t- Ensuring comprehensive financial regulation, through the following actions:\n\t\t\t\t\t- Require the mandatory registration of crypto-exchanges and digital wallets and make the use of cryptocurrencies less attractive, for example by charging entry fees for crypto-exchanges and digital wallets and/or imposing financial transaction taxes on cryptocurrency trading;\n\t\t\t\t\t- Ban regulated financial institutions from holding stablecoins and cryptocurrencies or offering related products to clients;\n\t\t\t\t\t- Regulate decentralized finance (such finance may, in fact, not be fully decentralized, given its central management and ownership, which form an entry point for regulation);\n\t\t\t\t\t- Restricting or prohibiting the advertisement of crypto-exchanges and digital wallets in public spaces and on social media. This new type of virtual, and often disguised, advertisement requires policymakers to expand the scope of regulation beyond traditional media. This is an urgent need in terms of consumer protection in countries with low levels of financial literacy, as even limited exposure to cryptocurrencies may lead to significant losses;\n\t\t\t\t\t- Creating a public payment system to serve as a public good, such as a central bank digital currency. In the light of the regulatory and technological complexity of central bank digital currencies and the urgent need to provide safe, reliable and affordable payment systems, authorities could also examine other possibilities, including fast retail payment systems.\n\t\t\t- This is tough talk. We have seen that the IMF is willing to make theirloans contingent on such regulation, and are increasingly [talking about banning](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/02/23/pr2351-imf-executive-board-discusses-elements-of-effective-policies-for-crypto-assets) the technology.

It is made up of one or more public keys.The documents can make use of services such as timestamps, cryptographicsignatures, proofs, delegations, and authorisations. They should containthe minimum amount of information to accomplish the specific taskrequired of them.\n\n\t- ### Federated social media trust\n\t\t- This section about newer technologies is perhaps best [summarised byJackDorsey](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/jackjack/issues/a-native-internet-protocol-for-social-media-1503112?via=twitter-card&client=DesktopWeb&element=issue-card),ex CEO of twitter, paraphrased here:\n\t\t\t- \"I’ll start with the principles I’ve come to believe based on everything I’ve learned and experienced through my past actions as a Twitter co-founder and Lead:\n\t\t\t\t- Social media must be resilient to corporate and government control.\n\t\t\t\t- Only the original author may remove content they produce.\n\t\t\t\t- Moderation is best implemented by algorithmic choice.\n\t\t\t- The biggest mistake I made was continuing to invest in building tools for us to manage the public conversation versus building tools for the people using Twitter to easily manage it for themselves this burdened the company with too much power and opened us to significant outside pressure such as advertising budgets. I generally think companies have become far too powerful. The only way I know of to truly live up tot hese three principles is a free and open protocol for social media that is not owned by a single company or group of companies and is resilient to corporate and government influence the problem today is that we have companies who own both the protocol and discovery of content which ultimately puts one person in charge of what’s available and seen or not this is by definition a single point of failure no matter how great the person and over time will fracture the public conversation and may lead to more control by governments and corporations around the world.\"\n\t\t- The following technologies were selected for this book long beforeDorsey wrote those words, but they itare the technologies in which he isinvesting his time and money to further those 3 principles. Keybase isan interesting example of how proofs ont he internet can lean upon oneanother to provide a corpus of trusts.

It also restricts AI systems for criminal risk assessment and broad data scraping.\n\t- A substantial change is that AI systems will not be considered high-risk if they do not pose a significant risk of harm subject to certain criteria being fulfilled (even if it's listed as a high-risk system).\n\t- High-risk AI systems are defined based on their potential harm to health, safety, and fundamental rights. Providers must document assessments and register these systems, continually evaluating risks based on various factors. It is for providers to assess whether or not their systems are high risk, and even if they aren't, registration will still be required to this effect along with record keeping of your assessment.\n\t- General Purpose AI models are introduced with a whole new chapter dedicated to them. Models used for research, development, or prototyping are excluded. Providers of high-risk models must comply with specific standards and appoint an EU representative if based outside the EU.\n\t- Deep fakes must be disclosed as AI-generated, with some exceptions.\n\t- Human oversight for high-risk systems is required, ensuring trained personnel are involved.\n\t- Employers using high-risk AI in the workplace must inform their workers, adhering to EU and national laws.\n\t- Testing of high-risk AI systems in real-world conditions is permitted under strict ethical and consent guidelines.\n\t- High-risk system providers must have agreements with third-party suppliers.\n\t- Simplified technical documentation requirements are in place for SMEs, with a 10-year record-keeping mandate.\n\t- The Act defines AI systems as machine-based systems that influence environments through various outputs.\n\t- Emotion and facial recognition systems are broadly defined, potentially impacting organisations using biometric data for sentiment analysis and law enforcement's use of real-time facial recognition.\n\t- Data governance focuses on the collection processes, origins, and purposes of data, particularly personal data.\n\t- Non-compliance fines are substantial, reaching up to €35 million or 7% of global annual turnover.\n\t- The Act specifies implementation timelines for different systems and deadlines for developing codes of practice.\n\npublic:: true\n\n\npublic:: true\n\n\npublic:: true\n\n\t- Public Page Automatically published\n- Ethereum[[buterin2013ethereum]] is the second most [secure](https://www.crypto51.app/) public blockchain (by about [50%](https://howmanyconfs.com/))[[sayeed2019assessing]], and second most valuable by [market capitalisation](https://coinmarketcap.com/) (though this comparison is somewhat stretched). It is the natural connection from Web3 to [[Blockchain]].\n- It is touted as ‘programmable money’. It, unlike Bitcoin, is [nearly](https://hackernoon.com/turing-completeness-and-the-ethereum-blockchain-c5a93b865c1a) Turing complete[[petzold2008annotated]], able to run a [virtual machine](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) within the distributed network (albeit slowly), and can therefore process complex transactional contracts in the settlement of value. This has given rise to the new field of ‘distributed finance’, or DeFi (described later), alongside many interesting trust-minimised immutable ledger public database ideas.\n- There are trade-offs and problems with Ethereum (Eth/Ether) that currently increase the ‘participation floor’ and make the network far less suitable for entry-level business-to-business use. The ledger itself, being a computational engine with write-only properties, is enormous. Specialist cloud hardware is required to run a full node (a copy of the ledger), and partial nodes are the norm. Many partial nodes are run by one specialist cloud provider ([Infura](https://consensys.net/blog/news/why-infura-is-the-secret-weapon-of-ethereum-infrastructure/)), which has been demonstrated capable of being forced to [exclude countries like Venezuela](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/metamask-infura-block-certain-areas-173749914.html) from the network. Network validators [refused to process](https://mevwatch.info) addresses on an [OFAC sanction list](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/office-of-foreign-assets-control-sanctions-programs-and-information). A staggering 58% run on [Amazon AWS servers](https://ethernodes.org/networkType/Hosting). Critics of the project point to these vulnerabilities to outside influence as an existential threat to the aims of the technology. If it can be censured, then what advantage is there over the [founders](https://protos.com/consensys-lawsuit-jpmorgan-owns-critical-ethereum-infrastructure/) simply running a high-speed database for the same purpose?\n- This is a function of the so-called ‘scalability trilemma’[[hafid2020scaling]], in which it seems that only two features from the list of decentralisation, scalability, or security can be chosen for blockchains[[bonneau2015sok]].\n- Moreover, the network is [centrally controlled](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/ethereum-is-coercive-bitcoin-is-not) by its creator and the ‘miners’. There is a strong case to answer that Eth is [neither distributed](https://blog.mollywhite.net/blockchains-are-not-what-they-say/), nor trustless, and in fact, therefore fails to be differentiated from a private permissioned ledger, undermining some of its claims. The history of Ethereum is a fascinating case study in human greed. By the time the white paper had its first limited release, [[Bitcoin]] had already passed $1000 per token. This led to the creators' ambitions for a ‘fair release’ of tokens being voted down by powerful funders, leading to the explosion of similarly structured ‘pre-mined’ coins in the ICO craze, which followed on the Ethereum network. Laura Shin is possibly the most experienced journalist and author in the space and has covered this crazy era in her book ‘The Cryptopians’[[cryptopians]]. It’s a tough read for the newcomer, though; perhaps finish this primer first!\n- With that said, there are many talented developers doing interesting work on the platform, and innovation is fast-paced. It is entirely normal for technology projects to launch their distributed ledger idea on and within the Ethereum network. These generate tradable ‘ERC-20’ tokens, which can accrue value or demonstrate smart contract utility (based on the [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) programming language). Because the value locked and generated in the Ethereum platform comes not just from the ETH token, but all the ERC technologies built upon it, there are hundreds of billions of pounds ‘within’ the network. All of these projects, and indeed the core technology of Ethereum, are subject to exploits and vulnerabilities, and tens of billions of pounds have been lost[[chen2020survey]]. Most of this money is pure market speculation (as is the case across blockchains). Many analysts cannot see this as anything but a speculative bubble, with all the predictable crashes yet to come. This can be seen in the context of other bubbles. It seems that most of the projects in crypto more generally, but certainly with ETH and the NFTs within it, are a new kind of social gambling, where online communities can reinforce groupthink around their speculative choices. This idea that Ethereum is not a commodity, but rather a security, built around promises of returns, is finding recent favour in law. New York Attorney General James has alleged that Ether is a security in [court proceedings](https://www.docdroid.net/Myyp0yz/kucoin-pdf#page=11), which could have enormous consequences, potentially reversing the momentum the asset had been enjoying as a commodity. Jason Lowery of MIT and US Space Force [lays out](https://twitter.com/JasonPLowery/status/1572275617344757760) a very clear thesis on the difference between Nakamoto consensus and most of what followed as part of his PhD[[Lowery2023]]. His explanation here is proximal to why we focus on Bitcoin and dismiss ‘proof of stake’ models, though Lowery himself has very serious detractors such as Voskuil, who has been working on these problems for a long time[[voskuil2020cryptoeconomics]].\n- “The innovation behind PoW is precisely the fact that it **doesn’t** rely exclusively on software (an abstraction) to keep the ledger systemically secure, but instead incorporates real-world physics (watts) to impose real-world physical constraints on people/computers who run it. Stake is an abstraction. It is an imaginary way to describe the complex emergent behaviour of a bunch of general-purpose state machines. The state machines may physically exist, but the way you choose to visualize the complex emergent behaviour of those machines is imaginary. Satoshi didn’t couple control authority over the ledger to abstract, imaginary things like ‘stake’ or ‘coin’ precisely because these things don’t physically exist. If they don’t physically exist, they are incapable of imposing real-world physical costs on people seeking control of the ledger. The real-world physical cost of controlling the ledger is what keeps control over the ledger decentralised. It is too physically expensive (in watts) to gain and maintain centralised control over the BTC ledger. In proof of stake, there is no physical cost of gaining centralised control. Why? Because stake doesn’t physically exist. So all it takes to gain centralised control is majority stake. And once you have it (which, because of math, some combination of people already do), you have it forever.\n- With all this said, most of the [couple of million people](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1266322/nft-user-number/) who have used NFTs use Ethereum, and if this market of creators and consumers is to be brought into a mixed reality space, then they will need a way to bring their objects with them.\n  \n  ![Image](./assets/d1f001aad6eb30671666fa1341235e1fde310172.jpg)\n  \n  Ethereum is thought to look like a speculative bubble. Rights requested.\n- Such is the level of nefarious activity on these networks (within Ethereum) that they have a poor reputation and are difficult to audit, launch, and maintain. The overriding problem of using a blockchain for utility applications (rather than just as money) is that people can, and will, simply lie for criminal purposes when entering data into the ledger. It is far more likely that Ethereum is simply a speculative bubble than any of the claims for utility being borne out. Add to that [Morgan Stanley's recent assertion](https://advisor.morganstanley.com/daron.edwards/documents/field/d/da/daron-edwards/Cryptocurrency_201__What_is_Ethereum_.pdf) that Ethereum is itself threatened by newer contender chains and its future becomes unclear. The report correctly identifies that “High transaction fees create scalability problems and threaten user demand. High costs make Ethereum too expensive for small-value transactions.” It is this high cost of use that most excludes the ERC-20 networks from our consideration.\n\npublic:: true\n\n- ![1719268663052.jpeg](assets/1719268663052_1719301674255_0.jpeg)\n- [https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard)\n- [https://huggingface.co/spaces/CultriX/Alt_LLM_LeaderBoard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CultriX/Alt_LLM_LeaderBoard)\n- [https://huggingface.co/spaces/opencompass/open_vlm_leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/opencompass/open_vlm_leaderboard)\n- [https://tatsu-lab.github.io/alpaca_eval/](https://tatsu-lab.github.io/alpaca_eval/)\n- [https://huggingface.co/spaces/bigcode/bigcode-models-leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/bigcode/bigcode-models-leaderboard)\n- [https://huggingface.co/spaces/NPHardEval/NPHardEval-leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/NPHardEval/NPHardEval-leaderboard)\n- [https://paperswithcode.com/sota/code-generation-on-humaneval](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/code-generation-on-humaneval)\n- [https://evalplus.github.io/leaderboard.html](https://evalplus.github.io/leaderboard.html)\n- [https://eqbench.com/](https://eqbench.com/)\n- [https://ayumi.m8geil.de/](https://ayumi.m8geil.de/)\n\npublic:: true\n\n\n\t- ### Media and Public Backlash\n\t\t- **Investigative Reporting**: Reports by The Wall Street Journal and other media highlighted internal conflicts and the company's focus on growth over safety.\n\t\t- **Whistleblower Revelations**: Francis Haugen's whistleblowing brought significant attention to the internal documents and the company's practices.\n\t\t- **Public Perception**: These revelations led to increased scrutiny and criticism of Facebook's impact on society and its prioritization of profits over safety.\n\npublic:: true\n\n\npublic:: true\n\n-\n\npublic:: true\n\n\npublic:: true\n\n- ![image (9).png](../assets/image_(9)_1753019256369_0.png)\n\npublic:: true\n\n\npublic:: true\n\n- #Public page automatically published\n- {{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG3g8mYKfqU}}\n\npublic:: true\n\n- #Public page automatically published\n\n- # The World Economic Forum\n\t- The World Economic Forum (WEF) is a non-governmental organization founded in 1971 by Klaus Schwab. It is well known for its annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, where world leaders, CEOs, and various stakeholders gather to discuss global issues and potential solutions.Although the WEF does not have direct control over policymaking, its influence on global policy arises from its role as a platform for dialogue and idea exchange, as well as its ability to bring together influential individuals.\n\t- As unelected technocrats, the WEF’s impact on global policy can be observed through these aspects:\n\t\t- Convening power: The WEF’s Davos meeting is a high-profile event that attracts prominent political figures, business executives, and other influential individuals. This ability to assemble people allows the WEF to initiate conversations on global issues, create networks, and establish connections among key players. These interactions can lead to ideas and initiatives that might eventually shape global policy.\n\t\t- Knowledge sharing and thought leadership: The WEF produces a range of publications, reports, and research that provide insights into various global challenges. By disseminating this knowledge, the WEF contributes to the broader understanding of complex issues and helps to inform policymaking by governments, businesses, and other organizations.\n\t\t- Agenda-setting: Through its conferences and publications, the WEF identifies and highlights emerging trends, risks, and opportunities, which can help to set the agenda for global policy discussions. By bringing attention to specific issues, the WEF can indirectly influence the priorities of governments and other decision-makers.\n\t\t- Public-private cooperation: The WEF actively promotes collaboration between the public and private sectors in addressing global challenges. By fostering partnerships and facilitating dialogue between these sectors, the WEF can help drive the development and implementation of policies that require cooperation between governments, businesses, and civil society.\n\t- Despite its influence, critics argue that the WEF’s position as unelected technocrats raises concerns about the organization’s legitimacy and accountability. They contend that the WEF’s ability to shape global policy without being directly answerable to citizens canundermine democratic processes and result in policies that prioritizethe interests of elites over the broader public. However, others arguethat the WEF’s role in facilitating dialogue and collaboration is essential for tackling complex global challenges that require coordinated action across sectors and borders.\n\t- Interesting for us the WEF recently released its annual [Global RisksReport](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_Global_Risks_Report_2022.pdf),which highlights various threats and challenges facing the world today,and which intersect with all of the narratives in this book. The reportdiscusses issues related to cybersecurity, public trust, and social cohesion, and underscores the importance of a comprehensive approach to addressing these challenges.\n\t- The WEF’s founder, Klaus Schwab, has previously argued for a “great reset” in society and the economy, which involves revamping various aspects of our lives, from education to social contracts and working conditions. This reset would require the construction of new foundations for economic and social systems.\n\t- The WEF Global Risks Report 2022 focuses on five main categories, which are also part of their “Great Narrative for Humankind” initiative:\n\t\t- Economy\n\t\t- Environment\n\t\t- Geopolitics\n\t\t- Society\n\t\t- Technology\n\t- The report emphasizes that the erosion of social cohesion has been a significant global issue since the start of the COVID-19 crisis. Inaddressing these challenges, the WEF suggests that public-private collaborations are necessary to ensure effective decision-making and to safeguard the future of humanity.\n\t- The report also highlights the increasing digital dependency that intensifies cyberthreats, as the WEF has long warned of the potential for a significant cyber pandemic. The rapid spread of a cyber attack with “COVID-like characteristics” could potentially cause more damage than any biological virus.\n\t- The WEF Global Risks Report 2022 delves further into the potential consequences of a cyber pandemic. In a section titled “Shocks to ReflectUpon” the report explores the possibility of a wide-ranging and costly attack that could lead to cascading failures in systemically important businesses and disrupt services, ultimately undermining digital transformation efforts made in recent year.\n\t- The report also emphasizes the need for governments to address cyberthreats and warns that without mitigation, the escalation ofcyber warfare and the disruption of societies could result in a loss oftrust in governments’ ability to act as digital stewards.\n\t- To better understand the risks associated with technology, the WEF report explores the concept of the fourth industrial revolution, whichSchwab believes will lead to the fusion of our physical, biological, and digital identities. This fusion will be facilitated by technologies suchas artificial intelligence, internet of things-enabled devices, edge computing, blockchain, and 5G. You can see they’re examining similar things to this book.\n\t- As explaining in this work, these technologies present numerous opportunities for businesses and societies, they also expose users to elevated and more pernicious forms of digital and cyber risk. The report also discusses the potential emergence of the metaverse, which could create new vulnerabilities for malicious actors by increasing the number of entry points for malware and data breaches, again a central theme of this text.\n\t- In light of these risks, the WEF report suggests that users will need tonavigate security vulnerabilities inherent in complex technologies characterized by decentralization and a lack of structured guardrails or sophisticated onboarding infrastructure.\n\t- The report also touches on the issue of digital identity as we do. Theyview digital identity is a crucial component of accessing products,services, and information in a digital world, but again, this raises concerns about privacy, security, and the potential for misuse.\n\t- Finally, the WEF Global Risks Report 2022 addresses the issue of publictrust, noting that the growth of deepfakes and disinformation-for-hirecan deepen mistrust between societies, businesses, and governments. Wecan already see this starting to happen as Musk’s defence lawyers [pointto possible deepfakeuse](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/27/elon-musks-statements-could-be-deepfakes-tesla-defence-lawyers-tell-court)around video comments he is alleged to have made with regard to Tesla’ssoftware safety. To rebuild trust and social cohesion, the report callsfor leaders to adopt new models, look long term, renew cooperation, andact systemically. Quite what they think they can do in the face ofimages like the recent memes of the Pope is unclear<a href=\"#fig:pope\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"fig:pope\">9.1</a>.\n\t- It’s absolutely crucial to note that the WEF is a powerful organisation,with global sway over policy, and is an enormous concentration of powerin the hands of unelected technocrats. The authors are very sceptical ofthe WEF, but this report highlights what both technocrats and policymakers are thinking. ![]./assets/2bcb50707bd7f4e4e47d11cc01170d997a0afc65.jpg Midjourney 5 fake images of The Pope Francis which are <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/midjourney/comments/120vhdc/the_pope_drip/\">circulating as memes</a> and show the power and the danger of the technology even at this early stage.\n\npublic:: true\n\n- #Public page\n\t - automatically published\n- {{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihvG3RgbYzE)}}\n\npublic:: true\n\n\t- #Public page automatically published\n\npublic:: true\n\n- #Public page\n\t- automatically published\n- Tracking and Capture\n\t- Physical Tracking\n\t\t- [Pico Motion Trackers first impressions: a potential game changer - The Ghost Howls (skarredghost.com)](https://skarredghost.com/2024/09/11/pico-motion-tracker-impressions/)\n\t\t- [CoTracker: It is Better to Track Together (co-tracker.github.io)](https://co-tracker.github.io/)\n\t\t- [Lens Studio (snap.com)](https://ar.snap.com/lens-studio)\n\t\t- Pose estimations [Standable](https://www.standablevr.com/)\n\t\t- [ScoreHMR (statho.github.io)](https://statho.github.io/ScoreHMR/)\n\t\t- Fast bounding [Kroery/DiffMOT: code for CVPR2024 paper: DiffMOT: A Real-time Diffusion-based Multiple Object Tracker with Non-linear Prediction (github.com)](https://github.com/Kroery/DiffMOT)\n\t- Emotion and remote biometric monitoring\n\t\t- emotion tracking\n\t\t- [laion empathetic](https://dct.openempathic.ai/guide/#:~:text=Rating%20Arousal%20and%20Valence%3A)\n\t\t- [Dense face fields from Microsoft](https://microsoft.github.io/DenseLandmarks/)\n\t- Ethics and Safety\n\t\t- The article discusses the potential risks and opportunities of motion tracking data in extended reality (XR) and the metaverse.

From leaded petrol in vehicles to lead-based paint in homes, this toxic metal has left its mark on entire generations worldwide.\n- **The Rise and Fall of Leaded Petrol**\n\t- In 1921, automakers discovered that adding lead to petrol prevented engine knocking, boosting performance. However, even early on, the toxicity of lead was recognised.\n\t- Despite health concerns, leaded petrol became the standard in the decades following World War II, as car ownership boomed globally.\n\t- Lead, expelled through exhaust, settled in soil and dust, poisoning the environment and those who inhaled it.\n- **The Lead-Crime Hypothesis**\n\t- A compelling correlation exists between environmental lead and violent crime trends. Both charts show a similar peak and decline – with lead exposure preceding the crime spike by roughly 23 years.\n\t- Economists like Rick Nevin and Jessica Reyes have studied this relationship extensively, finding convincing links across numerous countries.\n\t- A 2022 meta-analysis further strengthens the lead-crime hypothesis ([https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/regeco/v97y2022ics0166046222000667.html](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/regeco/v97y2022ics0166046222000667.html)).\n- **How Lead Ravages the Body and Mind**\n\t- Lead mimics calcium, disrupting essential processes in bones, muscles, and crucially, the brain.\n\t- **Lead damages the development of myelin, which insulates nerves in the brain.** This leads to slower communication, impaired brain growth, and reduced function in areas like the prefrontal cortex.\n\t- Effects of childhood lead exposure can include:\n\t\t- Lower IQ (loss of 5-8 points)\n\t\t- Increased aggression and impulsiveness\n\t\t- Difficulties with emotional regulation\n\t\t- ADHD, challenges with focus and planning\n- **Lead's Global Consequences**\n\t- While violent crime is the most extreme outcome, lead poisoning likely had widespread impacts on generations around the world.\n\t- Learning difficulties, challenges in the workplace, strained relationships, and even susceptibility to scams could arise from lead exposure.\n\t- Though many nations phased out leaded petrol in the 1970s and onward, the societal effects remain, particularly within ageing populations.\n- **Lead's Persistence and Ongoing Challenges**\n\t- Lead contamination remains a global issue:\n\t\t- Old lead paint in pre-1978 homes\n\t\t- Soil near former industrial areas, busy roadways\n\t\t- Water from aging lead pipes (seen in crises like Flint, Michigan)\n\t- Developing nations and marginalized communities shoulder a greater burden of lead exposure, highlighting environmental injustice.\n\t- There is no safe level of lead exposure.\n- **The Global Fight Against Lead**\n\t- While many nations have reduced leaded petrol use, it remains a problem in some regions.\n\t- Efforts to remediate contaminated soil and replace aging infrastructure are crucial.\n- Continued research into the long-term health effects of lead is vital, especially in developing countries.\n\t- **Environmental Injustice:** Lead poisoning exemplifies how marginalized communities suffer the worst effects of pollution, driven by those prioritising immediate profit.\n\t- **Corporate Responsibility:** Industries must be held accountable for the long-term health consequences of the substances they use, beyond the initial production phase.\n\t- **Chemicals in Our World:** Lead serves as a stark reminder; we must be vigilant about the potential dangers of chemicals widely used today, especially those impacting children's development.\n- **While the peak of lead exposure may be ending, its legacy demands attention on both an individual and societal level. This issue underscores the vital connection between our environment and our health across the globe.**\n\n- # UK\n\t- An Enduring Legacy: Unspecified Issues Stemming from Historical Lead Mining in the United Kingdom\n\t\t- [Lake District - Northern Mine Research Society](https://nmrs.org.uk/mines-map/metal/lake-district/)\n\t\t- Introduction: The Enduring Legacy of Britain's Lead Mines\n\t\t\t- Lead mining has shaped the industrial and economic history of the UK. [1]\n\t\t\t- Peak production occurred c. 1750–1850, when Britain was the world’s leading supplier of lead. [1]\n\t\t\t- The North Pennine field (Teesdale, Weardale, South Tynedale, Derwent) was the country’s most important region. [1]\n\t\t\t- Extraction dates back to Roman times and possibly earlier. [1]\n\t\t\t- Industrial Revolution towns required lead for roofing, piping, casting, paints and glazing. [1]\n\t\t\t- Centuries of mining left widespread environmental contamination and complex legacies.\n\t\t\t- “Unspecified issues” encompass persistent pollution, health risks, ecological damage and socio-economic challenges. [4]\n\t\t\t- Abandoned metal mines are the single largest source of metal pollution in English rivers. [4]\n\t\t\t- These issues demand a holistic approach spanning environmental science, toxicology, public health, ecology and socio-economics.\n\t\t\t- The legacy is intergenerational: 18th–19th century mining still poses 21st-century risks. [1][4]\n\t\t\t- Contaminants remain in soils, watercourses and ecosystems, with river-pollution targets set to 2038. [4]\n\t\t\t- “Legacy” signifies transfer of problems from past to present and future, requiring sustained management. [4]\n\t\t\t- Past industrial practices lacked awareness of long-term impacts; today’s generations bear the costs. [2]\n- The Environmental Scar: Contamination from Historic Lead Mining\n\t- Water Contamination: A Pervasive Threat\n\t\t- Mine closures initiated long-term contaminant release, scarring landscapes and ecosystems. [2]\n\t\t- Abandoned metal mines now dominate metal pollution in English rivers and the marine environment. [4]\n\t\t- c. 1 491 km of English rivers/estuaries are polluted by historic mining. [4]\n\t\t- Key contaminants: Pb, Cd, Zn, As, Cu, Ni; iron precipitates turn rivers orange. [4][10]\n\t\t- Point sources: flooded adits drain metal-rich groundwater continuously, especially during low flows. [4][18]\n\t\t- Diffuse sources: spoil heaps leach metals via rain and wind, contaminating sediments kilometres downstream. [4][14]\n\t\t- Examples: Hard and Spence Levels (Barney Beck); pre-2020 Carrshield Tailings Dam. [4][18]\n\t\t- Metal levels often exceed EQS, posing ecotoxicological risk. [17]\n\t\t- Climate change (drier summers, heavier storms) will likely exacerbate contaminants’ concentration and mobilisation. [8][10][21]\n\t\t- Remediation must anticipate altered hydrology and contaminant pathways. [8]\n\t- Soil Contamination: A Persistent Reservoir of Toxins\n\t\t- Mining and smelting wastes deposited on land elevate soil metal concentrations for centuries. [4][11]\n\t\t- Peak District mineralised soils average 2 400 mg/kg Pb; some smelter-proximate samples hit 206 000 mg/kg. [15][23][24]\n\t\t- Spoil heaps leach metals via rainwater, while wind-blown dust spreads contamination metres from source. [4][14]\n\t\t- Vegetables grown on contaminated soils retain excessive lead even after washing. [14]\n\t\t- Residents often unaware until testing reveals dangerous soil levels. [11][15]\n\t\t- Funding gaps leave many high-risk sites unchecked. [11]\n\t\t- Proactive, systematic land assessment is urgently needed to safeguard communities. [11]\n\t- Ecological Impacts: Harming Flora and Fauna\n\t\t- Aquatic life suffers: fish, invertebrates and diatoms show toxicity and structural damage. [4][10][18]\n\t\t- Calaminarian grasslands of metal-tolerant plants have emerged on spoil soils but are climate-vulnerable. [8]\n\t\t- Remediation may destroy these rare habitats, creating a conservation vs decontamination paradox. [8]\n\t\t- Crop yields and livestock health (deaths, lameness) have been impaired by lead exposure. [3][9][11][14]\n\t\t- Mining also caused deforestation, habitat fragmentation and altered watercourses. [7][25]\n\t\t- The legacy blends direct toxicity, landscape alteration and creation of unique ecosystems.\n\t- Overview of Key Historical Lead Mining Regions and Issues  \n\t  | Region                        | Era                        | Examples                       | Issues                                                       |  \n\t  |------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|  \n\t  | North Pennines               | Roman–20th C              | Killhope, Carrshield          | River/soil pollution, landscape scars, woodland decline      |  \n\t  | Yorkshire Dales              | Roman–19th C              | Grinton Mill, Barney Beck     | Polluted rivers, altered flows, diatom damage, spoil heaps   |  \n\t  | Wales                        | Bronze Age–1950           | Minera, Cwmystwyth            | River/soil pollution, livestock health, child poisoning      |  \n\t  | Derbyshire & Peak District   | Roman–19th C              | Odin Mine, Longstone          | River/soil pollution, occupational hazards, grasslands       |  \n\t  | Mendip Hills                 | Roman–20th C              | Charterhouse, Shipham         | River pollution, elevated soil Cd                            |  \n\t  | Leadhills/Wanlockhead        | Pre-17th C–1930s          | Leadhills Mine                | Extreme water/soil contamination, airborne pollution         |  \n\t  | Cornwall                     | Ancient–1991              | Wheal Jane                    | Major pollution incidents, ongoing water treatment           |  \n\t  | Lake District                | Historical                | Force Crag                    | Water pollution, passive treatment                           |\n- Public Health Ramifications: Lead Exposure and Consequences\n\t- Lead is a chronic multi-system toxicant; acute high doses also harmful. [5]\n\t- Developmental neurotoxicity in children has no safe threshold; BLLs ≥ 2 µg/dL reduce IQ. [5][15]\n\t- Cardiovascular, renal, haematological, gastrointestinal, reproductive toxicity and probable carcinogenicity are documented. [5]\n\t- Children absorb up to 53 % of ingested lead vs 5–15 % in adults; pregnant women’s BLLs rise mid-trimester. [5][35]\n\t- UKHSA intervention level is 0.24 µmol/L (5 µg/dL) for children < 16 and pregnant women. [35]\n\t- “No safe level of lead” emphasises need for minimisation. [11]\n\t- Legacy uses (paint, plumbing) continued until recently; public awareness remains low. [6][11]\n\t- Exposure through ingestion (soil, dust, water, food), inhalation (dust) and, less so, dermal contact. [6][9][14][15][24][32][36]\n\t- Child behaviours (hand-to-mouth, pica) heighten risk in contaminated areas. [15][36]\n\t- Case studies: Ceredigion child poisoned; Welsh livestock deaths; high lead in farm eggs. [11][14][29]\n\t- Leadhills risk assessment deemed current risk low with precautions, but contamination and diagnostic difficulty persist. [32][33]\n\t- England-wide study (2014–22) found 340 children with elevated BLLs, soil a major source.

Regulation is well behind thetechnology, to the alarm of some academicobservers.[[rosenberg2022regulation]]\n-\n\t - Abuse; because of the real-time and spatio-temporal abuse happens less like in the current web 2 social media, and more like in the real world, but with less opportunity for repercussions. It might be that natural language processing and machine learning can help with this, but it’s a tough problem. One idea might be to record the speech to text of interactions between participants, and flag to them if a “bullying, harassment, predation threshold” is met. This could be encrypted with the public keys of the participants and a notice sent to them that if they wished to follow up with authorities then they have the necessary attestations and proofs. This is minimally invasive and privacy preserving, and acts as a strong disincentive to repeat offence. It can also feed into a global “web of trust” reputation system in a ‘zero knowledge’ way. Users who flag abuse to the reputation system can leverage the machine learning opinion without revealing what happened (though they would have the data). This would also act as a disincentive without the social stigma issues of reporting.\n- Reporting could be achieved without machine learning identification of potential problems, but there would have to be a social cost to reporting (like gossiping incessantly about others) which would erode the social score of the reporting entity. This would mitigate bot based reputation harm.\n-\n\t - Miscommunication; which as we have seen in the early section of the metaverse chapter is both complex and hard to mitigate\n-\n\t - Lost information\n-\n\t - Distraction\n-\n\t - Jitter, judder, jagginess, and interruption of flow; because the network overhead is higher than other communication media it’s much more exposed to latency effects\n-\n\t - Physical harms, especially to developing brains and ocular systems\n- The UK is [positioning itself](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3137)to heavily regulate safeguarding in the space, with significant fines for non-compliance.

Government deficits add net financial wealth to the private sector. This increases private sector deposits and spending capacity. When people then spend this new money, it stimulates aggregate demand and economic activity. Several empirical examples demonstrate how increasing government deficits leads to higher GDPgrowth and inflation by injecting more money into the real economy.Conversely, austerity policies that reduce deficits, like higher taxes or less spending, destroy private sector financial assets and reduce economic activity. Therefore, government deficits and surpluses have a much more direct impact on the real economy compared to central bank operations that alter the supply of bank reserves.\n\t\t- In their paper for the 2023 central bank meeting at Jackson HoleEichengreen and Arslanalp[[Eichengreen2023]] argue that the 2008 global financial crisis and COVID-19 pandemic have caused public debt levels to balloon to unprecedented heights across advanced, emerging, and developing economies, and that contrary to the calls of major financial institutions, high public debts are unlikely to meaningfully decline in the foreseeable future.\n\t\t- They say this is because the conventional options for debt reduction like running large primary budget surpluses, relying on higher growth rates, or using inflation to erode real debt burdens are politically and economically infeasible today (though AI perhaps offers a slim productivity ‘out’). At the same time, changes in the global financial system like the rise of private creditors have made coordinated debt restructuring more challenging. As a result, the world will have to learn to live with persistently high public debts. This may be manageable for major advanced countries like the US that benefit from structural demand for their safe assets. But it poses greater risks for emerging and developing economies that lack this advantage. Creative solutions like GDP-indexed bonds, credit enhancements, and legal reforms are needed to facilitate sustainable debt restructuring for weaker countries weighed down by debt overhangs. Overall, the shift from bank to bond financing and the changing composition of creditors have reduced options for unwinding high public debts accumulated due to recent crises. It’s a mess.\n\npublic:: true\n\n- Lit survey for [[PEOPLE]] [[David Tully]] [[MUST]] In here for now.\n- {{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhWtpV-ZEeI}}\n- [chat-Sure thing!

Thisis a distributed identity management system that maps Nostr keys toDNS-based internet identifiers. In events of kind 0 (setmetadata), the“nip05” key can have an internet identifier as its value. Clients splitthe identifier into the local part and domain and make a GET request tothe specified URL. The response should be a JSON document with a “names”key containing a mapping of names to hex-formatted public keys. If thepublic key matches the one from the setmetadata event, the clientaccepts the association and considers the “nip05” identifier valid.\n\t\t\t- Clients may find users’ public keys from internet identifiers by firstfetching the well-known URL and then checking for a matching “nip05”.When following public keys, clients must prioritize the keys over NIP-05addresses. Public keys must be in hex format. Clients can enable userdiscovery through search boxes, allowing users to find profiles byentering internet identifiers. The identifier can be used as the “root”identifier, displayed as just the domain. The protocol supports bothdynamic and static servers by using the local part as a query string.\n\t- All this potentially provides a simply interface to the Metaverse, including:\n\t\t- simple cryptographic identity assurance\n\t\t- private peer to peer chat\n\t\t- email to private message relay\n\t\t- links into media on web hosts and [[NosDav]]\n\t- The pace of development on Nostr is dizzying. Peer to peer video and audio will allow us to link metaverse instances, between peers, through applications such as Monstr.\n\t- It’s notable that Nostr has it’s own inexpensive hardware signing device to protect identity in situations where this might be necessary.\n\t- The proposed integration of Nostr social media and messaging, a lightning layer with digital objects such as Fedimint, Zerosync or RGB, AI agents, Vircadia, and federated Bitcoin is the core value proposition of this book. This work pre-dates Meta and Zuckerbergs stated intent in this regard by 18 months, and is differentiated still by our focus on emerging markets and decentralisation.\n\t- NIP-05\n\t\t- At this time, the nascent identity layer in nostr leans on NIP-05. This is a distributed identity management system that maps Nostr keys to DNS-based internet identifiers. In events of kind 0 (setmetadata), the “nip05” key can have an internet identifier as its value. Clients split the identifier into the local part and domain and make a GET request to the specified URL. The response should be a JSON document with a “names” key containing a mapping of names to hex-formatted public keys.

The identifier can be used as the “root” identifier, displayed as just the domain. The protocol supports both dynamic and static servers by using the local part as a query string.\n\t- Nostr Protocol as the keystone\n\t\t- The Nostr protocol can be used to store and share valuable content across the network. This is ably demonstrated by the ‘Highlighter’ project which allows users to store important notes from around the web using nostr. In the context of our federated social media trust model, the Nostr protocol can serve as the underlying layer that connects various instances of virtual spaces, thus enabling seamless data exchange and interoperability among them. Highlighter demonstrates that nostr events can be leveraged to create, store, and interact with valuable across networks. By utilizing this concept, we can extend the functionality to support federated social media trust, allowing users to carry their reputation, identity, and cryptographic proofs across different virtual spaces and social media platforms.\n\t- Nostr marketplace in LnBits\n\t\t- The nostr markets plugin for LnBits allows virtual ‘stalls’ to be setup and payment to be mediated through nostr. This is obviously a great expansion to the usefulness of our integration\n\t- Integrating Cryptographic Proofs and Reputation\n\t\t- To create a trusted environment within the federated network, we must establish a mechanism for importing and verifying cryptographic proofs from various sources, such as social media sites and other digital platforms. By doing so, we enable users to bring their existing reputation and trust from these platforms into the new ecosystem, thus facilitating trust-based interactions and collaboration within the network. We can leverage the Nostr protocol and the NIP05 specification to import these cryptographic proofs, creating a secure and verifiable system for identity management and trust propagation. The NIP05 specification allows for the creation and verification of identity proofs within the Nostr protocol, thus enabling the seamless integration of trust and reputation data from external sources.\n\t- By utilizing the Nostr protocol as the underlying layer, we can establish connections between objects, people, and AI actors within the federated network. This interconnected ecosystem allows for seamless collaboration, information sharing, and trust-based interactions among all participants. The open-source collaboration infrastructure we propose can facilitate the development of various applications and services that leverage the federated network, such as virtual workspaces, AI-assisted creativity tools, and more. The uncensorable nature of this protocol further supports the inclusivity and accessibility we feel so important, ensuring that participants from different regions and backgrounds can take part in the digital society and contribute to its growth.\n\t- This federated social media trust model, built on the Nostr protocol, allows for the establishment of a robust, inclusive, and trust-based network that connects various virtual spaces, social media platforms, and AI systems. By leveraging the lessons learned from the other attempts in the space, and by maximising the inclusion of external cryptographic proofs from multiple sources, we can create a comprehensive trust system that fosters collaboration, innovation, and shared growth within the digital society.\n\t- The Nostr protocol, with its decentralized and open-source nature, provides a solid foundation for linking and federating objects, people, and AI actors across collaborative spaces in digital society. By leveraging the Nostr protocol, we can build a robust and trust-based network that interconnects various virtual spaces, social media platforms, and AI systems. One of the key aspects of this trust-based network is the ability to import cryptographic proofs from different sources, similar to Keybase’s approach to importing proofs from various social media sites (Keybase Proofs).\n\t- StrFry relays\n\t\t- The Stirfry relay software provides high-performance infrastructure for building decentralized social media applications on top of the Noster protocol. As an open source project written in C++, Stirfry emphasizes efficiency, flexibility, and community-driven governance.\n\t\t  At the core of Stirfry is its high-speed database engine. Rather than using a traditional SQL database, Stirfry implements the Lightning Memory-Mapped Database (LMDB)\n\t\t- an embedded key-value store optimized for performance. Reads are lock-free, enabling unlimited parallel query throughput. Writes require only a short-held lock, ensuring minimal interference. LMDB’s \"shadow paging\" design allows isolated read-only transactions via multi-version concurrency control (MVCC). This prevents reads from blocking writes and vice versa.\n\t\t  To maximize database performance, Stirfry stores Noster events directly in FlatBuffers\n\t\t- an efficient binary format allowing direct access without serialization. The original JSON payloads are preserved to facilitate transmission back to clients. Additional database files index events on fields like timestamps and authors, accelerating filter queries. Periodic compaction optimizes the layout for faster operations.\n\t\t- Stirfry adopts a multi-threaded, modular architecture. A websocket thread accepts new client connections and routes incoming requests. An ingester thread validates and pre-processes each request before passing to appropriate handlers. Doing signature checks and filter compilation upfront avoids repeating work. A single writer thread batches database writes to amortize transaction overhead. Multiple worker threads handle read queries, fairly scheduling between long and short requests. Dedicated monitor threads track active filters and stream matching events to subscribed clients. Passing messages between threads instead of sharing data structures improves efficiency.\n\t\t- Additional features further enhance Stirfry’s capabilities. Graceful shutdown support allows stopping new connections while existing ones complete. Hot configuration reloading provides runtime updates without restarting. Flexible write policy plugins enable custom content moderation. Streaming websocket compression and Zstandard dictionaries compress traffic. Syncing protocols like Negentropy facilitate efficient relay replication, powering mesh network topologies. Geo-replication by the relay.org community offers low latency worldwide access. The custom Templar HTML templating library assists crafting simple, fast decentralized frontends.\n\n\t\t- ### Double Ratchet Encryption and Ephemeral Keys:\n\t\t- The core of the new DM spec lies in the double ratchet algorithm, which employs three chains of keys:\n\t\t\t- **Root chain:** Established through an initial Diffie-Hellman key exchange using the participants' Nostr public keys. This creates a shared secret key that serves as the starting point for the ratchet.\n\t\t\t- **Sending chain:** Used for deriving ephemeral keys for encrypting outgoing messages. Each message uses a new ephemeral key, ensuring forward secrecy.\n\t\t\t- **Receiving chain:** Used for deriving ephemeral keys for decrypting incoming messages. The receiving chain ratchets forward upon receiving a message with a new ephemeral key, guaranteeing post-compromise secrecy.\n\npublic:: true\n\n- #Public page automatically published\n\npublic:: true\n\n\npublic:: true\n\n- #Public page\n\t - automatically published\n-\n\npublic:: true\n\n- #Public page\n\t- automatically published\n\npublic:: true\n\n- ![BB1mNtGj.jpeg](assets/BB1mNtGj_1716451730618_0.jpeg)\n- Microsoft are bringing parametric (volume) design to Meta Quest.\n\t- Microsoft is integrating parametric (volume) design capabilities into the Meta Quest platform, enhancing the expressivity of interfaces focused on retrieving and customizing artifacts through extended reality. This approach leverages parametric designs to simplify and streamline the design process, situating relevant design efforts within the usage context and embedding domain knowledge in the system. The integration aims to make design variations effortless, aligning with the concept of in-situ interaction with parametric designs, as described by Mario Carpo, where primary authors design generic objects, and secondary authors or interactors adapt variable aspects of the original notation at will.\n\npublic:: true\nicon:: ⚖️\nThis is a general purpose linking slide for future [[presentation]]\n\n\npublic:: true\n\n\n#Public page automatically published\n\n\n- # Corporations as final arbiters of truth\n  id:: 66f13d66-1c8e-45a9-9f8b-41c4cc68ef9c\n\t- ![Screenshot 2024-04-24 120742.png](assets/Screenshot_2024-04-24_120742_1713957367294_0.png){:height 841, :width 800}\n\t-\n\t- This painting is called \"The Shah Alam conveying the gift of the Dewani to Lord Clive\" and depicts a supposed key moment in the East India Company taking control of Indian territory. Specifically, the painting shows the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam handing over a document to Robert Clive of the East India Company after being defeated at the Battle of Buxar in 1765. The document being transferred granted the East India Company the right to collect taxes (the diwani) in the wealthy Indian provinces of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. This gave the British shareholder Company control over the finances of these regions. Of course the painting is not historically accurate, being what we now know to be 'fake new'. The actual transfer took place in a private tent, with the emperor forced to sign \"with a gun to his head\" after his defeat, rather than in a grand public ceremony as the painting depicts. The artist Benjamin West had also never been to India.\n\t- Though historically inaccurate, this image may capture a truth - that corporate interests, unchecked, can subsume the sovereignty of nations. The East India Company's reign in India was marked by oppression, famine, and the stripping of resources for the benefit of far-off shareholders. It is a stark lesson in the perils of allowing private entities to wield such dominion over people's lives. Companies like Google and Facebook have become the gatekeepers of knowledge, with algorithms that shape what billions of people see and believe. As they develop sophisticated AI models and collect massive amounts of data, are we entrusting them with the modern equivalent of the East India Company's power?\n\t- The diwani painting immortalized a dangerous fiction, the slick PR of Silicon Valley masks the power these firms now command over our minds and societies. The datasets and AI models of these digital colossi are the new currency of truth - and one largely minted behind closed doors. We have seen the consequences again and again:\n\t\t- Tobacco: For decades, Big Tobacco sowed doubt about the dangers of smoking, suppressing research and misleading the public. Millions died as corporate interests trumped scientific truth.\n\t\t- BPA: Chemical companies long insisted BPA plastics were safe, despite mounting evidence of hormone disruption and health risks. Only after massive public pressure did regulators act.\n\t\t- Climate Change: Fossil fuel giants knew the truth about climate change for decades, but funded denial and obfuscation to protect their bottom line. The cost will be borne by generations.\n\t\t- Opioids: Pharmaceutical companies downplayed the addiction risks of opioids, contributing to an epidemic that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. Profits were prioritized over people.\n\t\t- [Don’t rejoice yet, Elon Musk and his tech bros-in-arms are winning the global battle for the truth | Carole Cadwalladr | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/31/elon-musk-x-brazil-telegram-pavel-durov)\n\t- It would be nice to think that we could demand radical transparency, meaningful oversight, and the primacy of public interest over shareholder profits in the construction and deployment of epoch-defining AI.\n\t  One potential solution is the development of open source informational agents.

Otherwise, select another 2 or 3 public-tagged topics and repeat. The process can be attempted a maximum of 10 times. If 10 attempts do not surface a news item of worth, alert the user in the Logseq output.\n\t- **Extract Web Links**: Create a simple list of raw URLs found in the Perplexity response and remove duplicates.\n\t- **Detailed Information Scraping**: Process the identified links using the web scraper module from the models list in OpenWebUI to fetch in-depth summaries and additional content from the linked pages.\n\t- **Or Progress News Item**: Use the GPT4oV model from the OpenWebUI models list to process the raw Perplexity response and all ancillary summaries gathered from the web scraper. Return a detailed and highly technical description of the news item in JSON format, with web URLs and their summaries carefully segmented and linked as a knowledge graph.\n\t- **Enhancing with RAG**: Send the text elements of the GPT4-generated JSON to the RAGflow module in the models list, requesting that the knowledge be modified to include any opinions and ideas from the RAG corpus that intersect with the news item. Save the response to a Logseq block titled # Story Plus RAG.\n\t- **Generating Podcast Script**: Use Claude 3.5 to create a podcast script based on few-shot examples from the Logseq page labelled [[example podcast dialogue]]. Send the RAGflow-enhanced news story and the JSON-structured web links and summaries. The script should alternate dialogue between Bob and Sue, incorporating brief mentions of the web sources available in the episode notes.

Tim Berners Lee (of WWW fame) first mentioned the semantic web in 1999 Mark Berners-Lee Tim; Fischetti. Weaving the web.\n  title:: Semantic Web\n\t- “I have a dream for the Web [in which computers] become capable of analyzing all the data on the Web – the content, links, and transactions between people and computers. A \"Semantic Web\", which makes this possible, has yet to emerge, but when it does, the day-to-day mechanisms of trade, bureaucracy and our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines. The \"intelligent agents\" people have touted for ages will finally materialize.”\n- Attention developed around three core themes, ubiquitous availability and searchability of data, intelligent search assistants, and highly available end points such as phones, and ‘internet of things’ devices. This is certainly manifesting in home devices, but few people think of this as a Web3 revolution. Since ratification of the standards by the World Wide Web (W3C) consortium it seems that their imperative toward decentralisation has become lost. Instead, it can be seen that Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Apple have a harmful oligopoly on users data (Sean S Costigan. World Without Mind:) ()Threat of Big Tech (Franklin Foer). 2018.)\n- This is at odds with Berners-Lee’s vision, and he has recently spoken out about this discrepancy, and attempted to refocus the media onto Web3.0.\n\t- It is worth taking a look at his software implementation called Solid, which is far more mindful of the sovereignty of user data. \n\t  “Solid is an exciting new project led by Prof. Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, taking place at MIT. The project aims to radically change the way Web applications work today, resulting in true data ownership as well as improved privacy. Solid (derived from \"social linked data\") is a proposed set of conventions and tools for building decentralized social applications based on Linked Data principles. Solid is modular and extensible and it relies as much as possible on existing W3C standards and protocols.”\n- Excitement around this kind of differentiated trust model, hinted at in ubiquitous availability of data (and implemented explicitly in Solid), has led to exploration of different paths by cryptographers, and this will be described later. For instance, one of the main developers of Solid, Carvelho, is now a leading developer and propotent of Nostr, another very interesting option which will be described later.

El Salvador's adoption of Bitcoin was a historic moment in the world of Bitcoin and was met with a mix of excitement and scepticism. On June 9, 2021, the country's Legislative Assembly approved a bill introduced by President Nayib Bukele to make Bitcoin a legal tender alongside the US dollar, which has been used as the country's official currency since 2001.\n\t\t- President Bukele, who has been a vocal proponent of Bitcoin, stated that the adoption of Bitcoin was a way to promote financial inclusion and stability in the country, where more than 70% of the population is unbanked or underbanked. In a tweet, he stated, \"Bitcoin will have the same value as the US dollar. We will support both. They will have the same power of purchase and will be accepted in the same way.\"\n\t\t- The move was met with a lot of media attention and reaction, with some praising it as a bold and innovative step, while others raised concerns about the volatility of Bitcoin and their potential impact on the economy. President Nayib Bukele himself has faced criticism for his handling of political power and some of his actions have raised concerns about the potential for abuses of power. In 2021, President Bukele faced widespread criticism for his handling of the legislative process and his use of the military to secure the Legislative Assembly building during a political standoff with lawmakers. This led to allegations of intimidation and a violation of democratic norms, and raised concerns about his willingness to use force to achieve his political goals. Additionally, President Bukele has faced criticism for his use of social media to communicate with the public and his tendency to bypass traditional media outlets, which has raised concerns about the potential for censorship and the manipulation of information. With that said he seems much loved in the country, and the previously appalling safety statistics of the nation have radically improved.\n\t\t- In addition to the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender, El Salvador has also proposed the issuance of a Bitcoin-backed bond to finance various public works projects and promote the use of Bitcoin. The bond would be denominated in Bitcoin and would allow investors to directly participate in the country's development while also supporting the growth and adoption of Bitcoin.\n\t\t- Another ambitious project that has been proposed by President Bukele and his administration is the creation of \"Bitcoin City\", a new city that would mine Bitcoin at the base of a dormant Volcano, and offer considerable tax benefits to holders. The city would serve as a hub for innovation and a showcase for the potential of Bitcoin, and would offer a wide range of services, including housing, healthcare, education, and entertainment.\n\t\t- There has been a significant increase in the adoption of Bitcoin in El Salvador (to around 12%) and apparently increased inward investment to the country. Many businesses, both small and large, have started accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment, and there has been a growing interest in Bitcoin among the general population. Additionally, the government has been actively promoting the use of Bitcoin through various initiatives. There have also been efforts to educate the public about Bitcoin and its potential benefits, including increased financial security and reduced transaction fees compared to traditional banking systems.\n\t\t- Overall, the adoption of Bitcoin in El Salvador has been positive, far outstripping the number of people in the country with traditional bank accounts, and has the potential to greatly impact the country's economy and financial sector. However, it is important to note that there are still challenges to overcome, such as regulatory and infrastructure limitations, as well as ongoing concerns about the volatility and stability of Bitcoin.\n\t\t- Somewhat surprisingly the IMF have de-escalated their previously highly critical assessment of the move, toward a more [concerned and conciliatory tone](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/02/10/el-salvador-staff-concluding-statement-of-the-2023-article-iv-mission): [\"Bitcoin's risks should be addressed. While risks have not materialized due to the limited Bitcoin use so far---as suggested by survey and remittances data---its use could grow given its legal tender status and new legislative reforms to encourage the use of crypto assets, including tokenized bonds (Digital Assets Law). In this context, underlying risks to financial integrity and stability, fiscal sustainability, and consumer protection persist, and the recommendations of the 2021 Article IV remain valid. Greater transparency over the government's transactions in Bitcoin and the financial situation of the state-owned Bitcoin-wallet (Chivo) remains essential, especially to assess the underlying fiscal contingencies and counterparty risks.\"]\n\t\t- In terms of economic impact, it is still too early to determine the full effects of the adoption of Bitcoin in El Salvador. However, it is expected to have a positive impact on financial inclusion and stability, as well as reducing the reliance on traditional banking systems. The use of Bitcoin has the potential to lower transaction fees and increase financial security, which could be particularly beneficial for those who do not have access to traditional banking services.\n\t\t- Overall, the adoption of Bitcoin in El Salvador marks a significant step forward in the mainstream acceptance and adoption of Bitcoin and has the potential to set a precedent for other countries to follow. However, it is important to monitor the situation and assess the long-term impacts on the economy and financial sector.\n\t\t- Their official Bitcoin page shows the accumulation.\n\t\t\t- <iframe src=\"https://bitcoin.gob.sv/\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 600px\"></iframe>\n\n\t- ### Argentina's Economic Situation\n\t- **Inflation Surge**: Argentina's inflation rate hit 100%, the highest since 1991.\n\t- **Impact on Currency**: The Argentine peso's value is rapidly declining.\n\t- **Government Statistics**: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 13.1% since the year's start, but the government's data reliability is questioned.\n\t- **Public Struggle**: Citizens like Irene DeVita express the hardships faced due to the collapsing currency.\n\npublic:: true\n\n- Public page automatically published\n\npublic:: true\n\n\npublic:: true\n\n- #Public page automatically published\n\n\t- #### Machine to machine communication\n\t\t- It is likely best considered as a pivotal enabling technology strand which compliments [[Public Key Encryption]] infrastructure.

This has come pretty much out of nowhere but seems highlyrelevant to us if it sticks. From the text: Here is the bullet pointlist in LaTeX:\n-\n\t- **Empowering people and reinforcing skills** to foster awareness, access to trustworthy information and build a talent pool of virtual world specialists. By the end of 2023, the Commission will promote the guiding principles for virtual worlds, put forward by the Citizens’ Panel; and will develop guidance for the general public thanks to a ‘Citizen toolbox’ by the first quarter of 2024. As specialists on virtual worlds are essential, the Commission will work with Member States to set up a talent pipeline and will support skills development, including for women and girls, through projects funded by the Digital Europe Programme, and for creators of digital content through the Creative Europe programme.\n-\n\t- **Business: supporting a European Web 4.0 industrial ecosystem** to scale up excellence and address fragmentation. Currently, there is no EU ecosystem bringing together the different players of the value chain of virtual worlds and Web 4.0. The Commission has proposed a candidate Partnership on Virtual Worlds under Horizon Europe, possibly starting 2025, to foster excellence in research and develop an industrial and technological roadmap for virtual worlds. To foster innovation, the Commission will also support EU creators and media companies to test new creation tools, bring together developers and industrial users, and work with Member States to develop regulatory sandboxes for Web 4.0 and virtual worlds.\n-\n\t- **Government: supporting societal progress and virtual public services** to leverage the opportunities virtual worlds can offer. The EU is already investing in major initiatives, such as Destination Earth (DestinE), Local Digital Twins for smart communities, or the European Digital Twin of the Ocean to allow researchers to advance science, industries to develop precision applications and public authorities to make informed public-policy decisions. The Commission is launching two new public flagships: “CitiVerse”, an immersive urban environment that can be used for city planning and management; and a European Virtual Human Twin, which will replicate the human body to support clinical decisions and personal treatment.\n-\n\t- **Shaping global standards for open and interoperable virtual worlds and Web 4.0,** ensuring that they will not be dominated by a few big players. The Commission will engage with internet governance stakeholders around the world and will promote Web 4.0 standards in line with the EU’s vision and values.\n-\n\npublic:: true\n\n\npublic:: true\n\n- ![WhatsApp Image 2024-06-13 at 09.29.51_1881330c.jpg](assets/WhatsApp_Image_2024-06-13_at_09.29.51_1881330c_1718268091114_0.jpg){:width 400}\n\t- [Deepfake Video Call Scams Finance Bro Out of $25 Million (gizmodo.com)](https://gizmodo.com/deepfake-video-call-scams-finance-bro-out-25-million-1851227196)\n- [FCC-24-17A1.pdf](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-24-17A1.pdf) FCC makes robotcalls illegal after New Hampshire political stunt [Fake Biden robocall investigation targets 2 Texas companies | AP News](https://apnews.com/article/biden-robocalls-artificial-intelligence-new-hampshire-texas-a8665277d43d05380d2c7594edf27617)\n- [Bland AI Phone Calling Platform](https://www.bland.ai/) [[Cyber security and Cryptography]] [[Agents]]\n- [Viral deepfake videos of Le Pen family reminder that content moderation is still not up to par ahead of EU elections – Euractiv](https://www.euractiv.com/section/artificial-intelligence/news/viral-deepfake-videos-of-le-pen-family-reminder-that-content-moderation-is-still-not-up-to-par-ahead-of-eu-elections/)\n- [twitter link to the render loading below](https://twitter.com/BrivaelLp/status/1772023234512175290)\n- {{twitter https://twitter.com/BrivaelLp/status/1772023234512175290}}\n\npublic:: true\n\n- #Public page\n\t- automatically published\n\npublic:: true\n\n- #Public page\n\t - automatically published\n- PatchFusion [zhyever/PatchFusion: An End-to-End Tile-Based Framework for High-Resolution Monocular Metric Depth Estimation (github.com)](https://github.com/zhyever/PatchFusion)\n  title:: Depth Estimation\n- Marigold, [prs-eth/Marigold: Marigold: Repurposing Diffusion-Based Image Generators for Monocular Depth Estimation (github.com)](https://github.com/prs-eth/Marigold)\n- DMD-Mix, [[2312.13252v1] Zero-Shot Metric Depth with a Field-of-View Conditioned Diffusion Model (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13252v1)\n- ZoeDepth.

One of these was the previously discussed Swift international settlement network. Another whole category was the removal of support by private businesses domiciled outside of Russia and Ukraine, and pertinent here is that VISA, Mastercard, Paypal, and Western Union all removed support for their product rails. This means that while some cards and services still work, and will likely work again through Chinese proxies in the coming months, considerable disruption will be felt by Russian companies and individuals. This is not to say that this disruption is necessarily wrong, but it is clear now that all of these global financial transfer products and services are contingent on political factors. The same might be true of CBDC products if they gain traction globally. There is certainly no reason why all money within a physically delineated border could not be blocked or cancelled. This is not as true for Bitcoin at this time.\n\t\t\t- However, with enough political will it is technically plausible to incentivise miners with additional payments to exclude transactions from geolocated wallets. This would be mitigated by Tor, and in a global anonymous network it is very likely that a miner could be found at a higher price for inclusion in the next block.\n\t\t\t- We have already seen much negative political positioning related to the energy concerns in an earlier chapter. There are similar noises coming from policy makers with regard to the money utility of the technology. The United Nations [have made the following recommendations](https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/presspb2022d8_en.pdf):\n\t\t\t\t- “Developing countries may have less room to manoeuvre, yet the regulation of cryptocurrencies is possible. The following policies, among others, have the potential to curb the further spread of the risks of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins:\n\t\t\t\t\t- Ensuring comprehensive financial regulation, through the following actions:\n\t\t\t\t\t- Require the mandatory registration of crypto-exchanges and digital wallets and make the use of cryptocurrencies less attractive, for example by charging entry fees for crypto-exchanges and digital wallets and/or imposing financial transaction taxes on cryptocurrency trading;\n\t\t\t\t\t- Ban regulated financial institutions from holding stablecoins and cryptocurrencies or offering related products to clients;\n\t\t\t\t\t- Regulate decentralized finance (such finance may, in fact, not be fully decentralized, given its central management and ownership, which form an entry point for regulation);\n\t\t\t\t\t- Restricting or prohibiting the advertisement of crypto-exchanges and digital wallets in public spaces and on social media. This new type of virtual, and often disguised, advertisement requires policymakers to expand the scope of regulation beyond traditional media. This is an urgent need in terms of consumer protection in countries with low levels of financial literacy, as even limited exposure to cryptocurrencies may lead to significant losses;\n\t\t\t\t\t- Creating a public payment system to serve as a public good, such as a central bank digital currency. In the light of the regulatory and technological complexity of central bank digital currencies and the urgent need to provide safe, reliable and affordable payment systems, authorities could also examine other possibilities, including fast retail payment systems.\n\t\t\t- This is tough talk. We have seen that the IMF is willing to make theirloans contingent on such regulation, and are increasingly [talking about banning](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/02/23/pr2351-imf-executive-board-discusses-elements-of-effective-policies-for-crypto-assets) the technology.

It is made up of one or more public keys.The documents can make use of services such as timestamps, cryptographicsignatures, proofs, delegations, and authorisations. They should containthe minimum amount of information to accomplish the specific taskrequired of them.\n\n\t- ### Federated social media trust\n\t\t- This section about newer technologies is perhaps best [summarised byJackDorsey](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/jackjack/issues/a-native-internet-protocol-for-social-media-1503112?via=twitter-card&client=DesktopWeb&element=issue-card),ex CEO of twitter, paraphrased here:\n\t\t\t- \"I’ll start with the principles I’ve come to believe based on everything I’ve learned and experienced through my past actions as a Twitter co-founder and Lead:\n\t\t\t\t- Social media must be resilient to corporate and government control.\n\t\t\t\t- Only the original author may remove content they produce.\n\t\t\t\t- Moderation is best implemented by algorithmic choice.\n\t\t\t- The biggest mistake I made was continuing to invest in building tools for us to manage the public conversation versus building tools for the people using Twitter to easily manage it for themselves this burdened the company with too much power and opened us to significant outside pressure such as advertising budgets. I generally think companies have become far too powerful. The only way I know of to truly live up tot hese three principles is a free and open protocol for social media that is not owned by a single company or group of companies and is resilient to corporate and government influence the problem today is that we have companies who own both the protocol and discovery of content which ultimately puts one person in charge of what’s available and seen or not this is by definition a single point of failure no matter how great the person and over time will fracture the public conversation and may lead to more control by governments and corporations around the world.\"\n\t\t- The following technologies were selected for this book long beforeDorsey wrote those words, but they itare the technologies in which he isinvesting his time and money to further those 3 principles. Keybase isan interesting example of how proofs ont he internet can lean upon oneanother to provide a corpus of trusts.

It also restricts AI systems for criminal risk assessment and broad data scraping.\n\t- A substantial change is that AI systems will not be considered high-risk if they do not pose a significant risk of harm subject to certain criteria being fulfilled (even if it's listed as a high-risk system).\n\t- High-risk AI systems are defined based on their potential harm to health, safety, and fundamental rights. Providers must document assessments and register these systems, continually evaluating risks based on various factors. It is for providers to assess whether or not their systems are high risk, and even if they aren't, registration will still be required to this effect along with record keeping of your assessment.\n\t- General Purpose AI models are introduced with a whole new chapter dedicated to them. Models used for research, development, or prototyping are excluded. Providers of high-risk models must comply with specific standards and appoint an EU representative if based outside the EU.\n\t- Deep fakes must be disclosed as AI-generated, with some exceptions.\n\t- Human oversight for high-risk systems is required, ensuring trained personnel are involved.\n\t- Employers using high-risk AI in the workplace must inform their workers, adhering to EU and national laws.\n\t- Testing of high-risk AI systems in real-world conditions is permitted under strict ethical and consent guidelines.\n\t- High-risk system providers must have agreements with third-party suppliers.\n\t- Simplified technical documentation requirements are in place for SMEs, with a 10-year record-keeping mandate.\n\t- The Act defines AI systems as machine-based systems that influence environments through various outputs.\n\t- Emotion and facial recognition systems are broadly defined, potentially impacting organisations using biometric data for sentiment analysis and law enforcement's use of real-time facial recognition.\n\t- Data governance focuses on the collection processes, origins, and purposes of data, particularly personal data.\n\t- Non-compliance fines are substantial, reaching up to €35 million or 7% of global annual turnover.\n\t- The Act specifies implementation timelines for different systems and deadlines for developing codes of practice.\n\npublic:: true\n\n\npublic:: true\n\n\npublic:: true\n\n\t- Public Page Automatically published\n- Ethereum[[buterin2013ethereum]] is the second most [secure](https://www.crypto51.app/) public blockchain (by about [50%](https://howmanyconfs.com/))[[sayeed2019assessing]], and second most valuable by [market capitalisation](https://coinmarketcap.com/) (though this comparison is somewhat stretched). It is the natural connection from Web3 to [[Blockchain]].\n- It is touted as ‘programmable money’. It, unlike Bitcoin, is [nearly](https://hackernoon.com/turing-completeness-and-the-ethereum-blockchain-c5a93b865c1a) Turing complete[[petzold2008annotated]], able to run a [virtual machine](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) within the distributed network (albeit slowly), and can therefore process complex transactional contracts in the settlement of value. This has given rise to the new field of ‘distributed finance’, or DeFi (described later), alongside many interesting trust-minimised immutable ledger public database ideas.\n- There are trade-offs and problems with Ethereum (Eth/Ether) that currently increase the ‘participation floor’ and make the network far less suitable for entry-level business-to-business use. The ledger itself, being a computational engine with write-only properties, is enormous. Specialist cloud hardware is required to run a full node (a copy of the ledger), and partial nodes are the norm. Many partial nodes are run by one specialist cloud provider ([Infura](https://consensys.net/blog/news/why-infura-is-the-secret-weapon-of-ethereum-infrastructure/)), which has been demonstrated capable of being forced to [exclude countries like Venezuela](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/metamask-infura-block-certain-areas-173749914.html) from the network. Network validators [refused to process](https://mevwatch.info) addresses on an [OFAC sanction list](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/office-of-foreign-assets-control-sanctions-programs-and-information). A staggering 58% run on [Amazon AWS servers](https://ethernodes.org/networkType/Hosting). Critics of the project point to these vulnerabilities to outside influence as an existential threat to the aims of the technology. If it can be censured, then what advantage is there over the [founders](https://protos.com/consensys-lawsuit-jpmorgan-owns-critical-ethereum-infrastructure/) simply running a high-speed database for the same purpose?\n- This is a function of the so-called ‘scalability trilemma’[[hafid2020scaling]], in which it seems that only two features from the list of decentralisation, scalability, or security can be chosen for blockchains[[bonneau2015sok]].\n- Moreover, the network is [centrally controlled](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/ethereum-is-coercive-bitcoin-is-not) by its creator and the ‘miners’. There is a strong case to answer that Eth is [neither distributed](https://blog.mollywhite.net/blockchains-are-not-what-they-say/), nor trustless, and in fact, therefore fails to be differentiated from a private permissioned ledger, undermining some of its claims. The history of Ethereum is a fascinating case study in human greed. By the time the white paper had its first limited release, [[Bitcoin]] had already passed $1000 per token. This led to the creators' ambitions for a ‘fair release’ of tokens being voted down by powerful funders, leading to the explosion of similarly structured ‘pre-mined’ coins in the ICO craze, which followed on the Ethereum network. Laura Shin is possibly the most experienced journalist and author in the space and has covered this crazy era in her book ‘The Cryptopians’[[cryptopians]]. It’s a tough read for the newcomer, though; perhaps finish this primer first!\n- With that said, there are many talented developers doing interesting work on the platform, and innovation is fast-paced. It is entirely normal for technology projects to launch their distributed ledger idea on and within the Ethereum network. These generate tradable ‘ERC-20’ tokens, which can accrue value or demonstrate smart contract utility (based on the [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) programming language). Because the value locked and generated in the Ethereum platform comes not just from the ETH token, but all the ERC technologies built upon it, there are hundreds of billions of pounds ‘within’ the network. All of these projects, and indeed the core technology of Ethereum, are subject to exploits and vulnerabilities, and tens of billions of pounds have been lost[[chen2020survey]]. Most of this money is pure market speculation (as is the case across blockchains). Many analysts cannot see this as anything but a speculative bubble, with all the predictable crashes yet to come. This can be seen in the context of other bubbles. It seems that most of the projects in crypto more generally, but certainly with ETH and the NFTs within it, are a new kind of social gambling, where online communities can reinforce groupthink around their speculative choices. This idea that Ethereum is not a commodity, but rather a security, built around promises of returns, is finding recent favour in law. New York Attorney General James has alleged that Ether is a security in [court proceedings](https://www.docdroid.net/Myyp0yz/kucoin-pdf#page=11), which could have enormous consequences, potentially reversing the momentum the asset had been enjoying as a commodity. Jason Lowery of MIT and US Space Force [lays out](https://twitter.com/JasonPLowery/status/1572275617344757760) a very clear thesis on the difference between Nakamoto consensus and most of what followed as part of his PhD[[Lowery2023]]. His explanation here is proximal to why we focus on Bitcoin and dismiss ‘proof of stake’ models, though Lowery himself has very serious detractors such as Voskuil, who has been working on these problems for a long time[[voskuil2020cryptoeconomics]].\n- “The innovation behind PoW is precisely the fact that it **doesn’t** rely exclusively on software (an abstraction) to keep the ledger systemically secure, but instead incorporates real-world physics (watts) to impose real-world physical constraints on people/computers who run it. Stake is an abstraction. It is an imaginary way to describe the complex emergent behaviour of a bunch of general-purpose state machines. The state machines may physically exist, but the way you choose to visualize the complex emergent behaviour of those machines is imaginary. Satoshi didn’t couple control authority over the ledger to abstract, imaginary things like ‘stake’ or ‘coin’ precisely because these things don’t physically exist. If they don’t physically exist, they are incapable of imposing real-world physical costs on people seeking control of the ledger. The real-world physical cost of controlling the ledger is what keeps control over the ledger decentralised. It is too physically expensive (in watts) to gain and maintain centralised control over the BTC ledger. In proof of stake, there is no physical cost of gaining centralised control. Why? Because stake doesn’t physically exist. So all it takes to gain centralised control is majority stake. And once you have it (which, because of math, some combination of people already do), you have it forever.\n- With all this said, most of the [couple of million people](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1266322/nft-user-number/) who have used NFTs use Ethereum, and if this market of creators and consumers is to be brought into a mixed reality space, then they will need a way to bring their objects with them.\n  \n  ![Image](./assets/d1f001aad6eb30671666fa1341235e1fde310172.jpg)\n  \n  Ethereum is thought to look like a speculative bubble. Rights requested.\n- Such is the level of nefarious activity on these networks (within Ethereum) that they have a poor reputation and are difficult to audit, launch, and maintain. The overriding problem of using a blockchain for utility applications (rather than just as money) is that people can, and will, simply lie for criminal purposes when entering data into the ledger. It is far more likely that Ethereum is simply a speculative bubble than any of the claims for utility being borne out. Add to that [Morgan Stanley's recent assertion](https://advisor.morganstanley.com/daron.edwards/documents/field/d/da/daron-edwards/Cryptocurrency_201__What_is_Ethereum_.pdf) that Ethereum is itself threatened by newer contender chains and its future becomes unclear. The report correctly identifies that “High transaction fees create scalability problems and threaten user demand. High costs make Ethereum too expensive for small-value transactions.” It is this high cost of use that most excludes the ERC-20 networks from our consideration.\n\npublic:: true\n\n- ![1719268663052.jpeg](assets/1719268663052_1719301674255_0.jpeg)\n- [https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard)\n- [https://huggingface.co/spaces/CultriX/Alt_LLM_LeaderBoard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CultriX/Alt_LLM_LeaderBoard)\n- [https://huggingface.co/spaces/opencompass/open_vlm_leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/opencompass/open_vlm_leaderboard)\n- [https://tatsu-lab.github.io/alpaca_eval/](https://tatsu-lab.github.io/alpaca_eval/)\n- [https://huggingface.co/spaces/bigcode/bigcode-models-leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/bigcode/bigcode-models-leaderboard)\n- [https://huggingface.co/spaces/NPHardEval/NPHardEval-leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/NPHardEval/NPHardEval-leaderboard)\n- [https://paperswithcode.com/sota/code-generation-on-humaneval](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/code-generation-on-humaneval)\n- [https://evalplus.github.io/leaderboard.html](https://evalplus.github.io/leaderboard.html)\n- [https://eqbench.com/](https://eqbench.com/)\n- [https://ayumi.m8geil.de/](https://ayumi.m8geil.de/)\n\npublic:: true\n\n\n\t- ### Media and Public Backlash\n\t\t- **Investigative Reporting**: Reports by The Wall Street Journal and other media highlighted internal conflicts and the company's focus on growth over safety.\n\t\t- **Whistleblower Revelations**: Francis Haugen's whistleblowing brought significant attention to the internal documents and the company's practices.\n\t\t- **Public Perception**: These revelations led to increased scrutiny and criticism of Facebook's impact on society and its prioritization of profits over safety.\n\npublic:: true\n\n\npublic:: true\n\n-\n\npublic:: true\n\n\npublic:: true\n\n- ![image (9).png](../assets/image_(9)_1753019256369_0.png)\n\npublic:: true\n\n- #Public page automatically published\n- {{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG3g8mYKfqU}}\n\npublic:: true\n\n- #Public page automatically published\n\n- # The World Economic Forum\n\t- The World Economic Forum (WEF) is a non-governmental organization founded in 1971 by Klaus Schwab. It is well known for its annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, where world leaders, CEOs, and various stakeholders gather to discuss global issues and potential solutions.Although the WEF does not have direct control over policymaking, its influence on global policy arises from its role as a platform for dialogue and idea exchange, as well as its ability to bring together influential individuals.\n\t- As unelected technocrats, the WEF’s impact on global policy can be observed through these aspects:\n\t\t- Convening power: The WEF’s Davos meeting is a high-profile event that attracts prominent political figures, business executives, and other influential individuals. This ability to assemble people allows the WEF to initiate conversations on global issues, create networks, and establish connections among key players. These interactions can lead to ideas and initiatives that might eventually shape global policy.\n\t\t- Knowledge sharing and thought leadership: The WEF produces a range of publications, reports, and research that provide insights into various global challenges. By disseminating this knowledge, the WEF contributes to the broader understanding of complex issues and helps to inform policymaking by governments, businesses, and other organizations.\n\t\t- Agenda-setting: Through its conferences and publications, the WEF identifies and highlights emerging trends, risks, and opportunities, which can help to set the agenda for global policy discussions. By bringing attention to specific issues, the WEF can indirectly influence the priorities of governments and other decision-makers.\n\t\t- Public-private cooperation: The WEF actively promotes collaboration between the public and private sectors in addressing global challenges. By fostering partnerships and facilitating dialogue between these sectors, the WEF can help drive the development and implementation of policies that require cooperation between governments, businesses, and civil society.\n\t- Despite its influence, critics argue that the WEF’s position as unelected technocrats raises concerns about the organization’s legitimacy and accountability. They contend that the WEF’s ability to shape global policy without being directly answerable to citizens canundermine democratic processes and result in policies that prioritizethe interests of elites over the broader public. However, others arguethat the WEF’s role in facilitating dialogue and collaboration is essential for tackling complex global challenges that require coordinated action across sectors and borders.\n\t- Interesting for us the WEF recently released its annual [Global RisksReport](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_Global_Risks_Report_2022.pdf),which highlights various threats and challenges facing the world today,and which intersect with all of the narratives in this book. The reportdiscusses issues related to cybersecurity, public trust, and social cohesion, and underscores the importance of a comprehensive approach to addressing these challenges.\n\t- The WEF’s founder, Klaus Schwab, has previously argued for a “great reset” in society and the economy, which involves revamping various aspects of our lives, from education to social contracts and working conditions. This reset would require the construction of new foundations for economic and social systems.\n\t- The WEF Global Risks Report 2022 focuses on five main categories, which are also part of their “Great Narrative for Humankind” initiative:\n\t\t- Economy\n\t\t- Environment\n\t\t- Geopolitics\n\t\t- Society\n\t\t- Technology\n\t- The report emphasizes that the erosion of social cohesion has been a significant global issue since the start of the COVID-19 crisis. Inaddressing these challenges, the WEF suggests that public-private collaborations are necessary to ensure effective decision-making and to safeguard the future of humanity.\n\t- The report also highlights the increasing digital dependency that intensifies cyberthreats, as the WEF has long warned of the potential for a significant cyber pandemic. The rapid spread of a cyber attack with “COVID-like characteristics” could potentially cause more damage than any biological virus.\n\t- The WEF Global Risks Report 2022 delves further into the potential consequences of a cyber pandemic. In a section titled “Shocks to ReflectUpon” the report explores the possibility of a wide-ranging and costly attack that could lead to cascading failures in systemically important businesses and disrupt services, ultimately undermining digital transformation efforts made in recent year.\n\t- The report also emphasizes the need for governments to address cyberthreats and warns that without mitigation, the escalation ofcyber warfare and the disruption of societies could result in a loss oftrust in governments’ ability to act as digital stewards.\n\t- To better understand the risks associated with technology, the WEF report explores the concept of the fourth industrial revolution, whichSchwab believes will lead to the fusion of our physical, biological, and digital identities. This fusion will be facilitated by technologies suchas artificial intelligence, internet of things-enabled devices, edge computing, blockchain, and 5G. You can see they’re examining similar things to this book.\n\t- As explaining in this work, these technologies present numerous opportunities for businesses and societies, they also expose users to elevated and more pernicious forms of digital and cyber risk. The report also discusses the potential emergence of the metaverse, which could create new vulnerabilities for malicious actors by increasing the number of entry points for malware and data breaches, again a central theme of this text.\n\t- In light of these risks, the WEF report suggests that users will need tonavigate security vulnerabilities inherent in complex technologies characterized by decentralization and a lack of structured guardrails or sophisticated onboarding infrastructure.\n\t- The report also touches on the issue of digital identity as we do. Theyview digital identity is a crucial component of accessing products,services, and information in a digital world, but again, this raises concerns about privacy, security, and the potential for misuse.\n\t- Finally, the WEF Global Risks Report 2022 addresses the issue of publictrust, noting that the growth of deepfakes and disinformation-for-hirecan deepen mistrust between societies, businesses, and governments. Wecan already see this starting to happen as Musk’s defence lawyers [pointto possible deepfakeuse](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/27/elon-musks-statements-could-be-deepfakes-tesla-defence-lawyers-tell-court)around video comments he is alleged to have made with regard to Tesla’ssoftware safety. To rebuild trust and social cohesion, the report callsfor leaders to adopt new models, look long term, renew cooperation, andact systemically. Quite what they think they can do in the face ofimages like the recent memes of the Pope is unclear<a href=\"#fig:pope\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"fig:pope\">9.1</a>.\n\t- It’s absolutely crucial to note that the WEF is a powerful organisation,with global sway over policy, and is an enormous concentration of powerin the hands of unelected technocrats. The authors are very sceptical ofthe WEF, but this report highlights what both technocrats and policymakers are thinking. ![]./assets/2bcb50707bd7f4e4e47d11cc01170d997a0afc65.jpg Midjourney 5 fake images of The Pope Francis which are <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/midjourney/comments/120vhdc/the_pope_drip/\">circulating as memes</a> and show the power and the danger of the technology even at this early stage.\n\npublic:: true\n\n- #Public page\n\t - automatically published\n- {{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihvG3RgbYzE)}}\n\npublic:: true\n\n\t- #Public page automatically published\n\npublic:: true\n\n- #Public page\n\t- automatically published\n- Tracking and Capture\n\t- Physical Tracking\n\t\t- [Pico Motion Trackers first impressions: a potential game changer - The Ghost Howls (skarredghost.com)](https://skarredghost.com/2024/09/11/pico-motion-tracker-impressions/)\n\t\t- [CoTracker: It is Better to Track Together (co-tracker.github.io)](https://co-tracker.github.io/)\n\t\t- [Lens Studio (snap.com)](https://ar.snap.com/lens-studio)\n\t\t- Pose estimations [Standable](https://www.standablevr.com/)\n\t\t- [ScoreHMR (statho.github.io)](https://statho.github.io/ScoreHMR/)\n\t\t- Fast bounding [Kroery/DiffMOT: code for CVPR2024 paper: DiffMOT: A Real-time Diffusion-based Multiple Object Tracker with Non-linear Prediction (github.com)](https://github.com/Kroery/DiffMOT)\n\t- Emotion and remote biometric monitoring\n\t\t- emotion tracking\n\t\t- [laion empathetic](https://dct.openempathic.ai/guide/#:~:text=Rating%20Arousal%20and%20Valence%3A)\n\t\t- [Dense face fields from Microsoft](https://microsoft.github.io/DenseLandmarks/)\n\t- Ethics and Safety\n\t\t- The article discusses the potential risks and opportunities of motion tracking data in extended reality (XR) and the metaverse.

From leaded petrol in vehicles to lead-based paint in homes, this toxic metal has left its mark on entire generations worldwide.\n- **The Rise and Fall of Leaded Petrol**\n\t- In 1921, automakers discovered that adding lead to petrol prevented engine knocking, boosting performance. However, even early on, the toxicity of lead was recognised.\n\t- Despite health concerns, leaded petrol became the standard in the decades following World War II, as car ownership boomed globally.\n\t- Lead, expelled through exhaust, settled in soil and dust, poisoning the environment and those who inhaled it.\n- **The Lead-Crime Hypothesis**\n\t- A compelling correlation exists between environmental lead and violent crime trends. Both charts show a similar peak and decline – with lead exposure preceding the crime spike by roughly 23 years.\n\t- Economists like Rick Nevin and Jessica Reyes have studied this relationship extensively, finding convincing links across numerous countries.\n\t- A 2022 meta-analysis further strengthens the lead-crime hypothesis ([https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/regeco/v97y2022ics0166046222000667.html](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/regeco/v97y2022ics0166046222000667.html)).\n- **How Lead Ravages the Body and Mind**\n\t- Lead mimics calcium, disrupting essential processes in bones, muscles, and crucially, the brain.\n\t- **Lead damages the development of myelin, which insulates nerves in the brain.** This leads to slower communication, impaired brain growth, and reduced function in areas like the prefrontal cortex.\n\t- Effects of childhood lead exposure can include:\n\t\t- Lower IQ (loss of 5-8 points)\n\t\t- Increased aggression and impulsiveness\n\t\t- Difficulties with emotional regulation\n\t\t- ADHD, challenges with focus and planning\n- **Lead's Global Consequences**\n\t- While violent crime is the most extreme outcome, lead poisoning likely had widespread impacts on generations around the world.\n\t- Learning difficulties, challenges in the workplace, strained relationships, and even susceptibility to scams could arise from lead exposure.\n\t- Though many nations phased out leaded petrol in the 1970s and onward, the societal effects remain, particularly within ageing populations.\n- **Lead's Persistence and Ongoing Challenges**\n\t- Lead contamination remains a global issue:\n\t\t- Old lead paint in pre-1978 homes\n\t\t- Soil near former industrial areas, busy roadways\n\t\t- Water from aging lead pipes (seen in crises like Flint, Michigan)\n\t- Developing nations and marginalized communities shoulder a greater burden of lead exposure, highlighting environmental injustice.\n\t- There is no safe level of lead exposure.\n- **The Global Fight Against Lead**\n\t- While many nations have reduced leaded petrol use, it remains a problem in some regions.\n\t- Efforts to remediate contaminated soil and replace aging infrastructure are crucial.\n- Continued research into the long-term health effects of lead is vital, especially in developing countries.\n\t- **Environmental Injustice:** Lead poisoning exemplifies how marginalized communities suffer the worst effects of pollution, driven by those prioritising immediate profit.\n\t- **Corporate Responsibility:** Industries must be held accountable for the long-term health consequences of the substances they use, beyond the initial production phase.\n\t- **Chemicals in Our World:** Lead serves as a stark reminder; we must be vigilant about the potential dangers of chemicals widely used today, especially those impacting children's development.\n- **While the peak of lead exposure may be ending, its legacy demands attention on both an individual and societal level. This issue underscores the vital connection between our environment and our health across the globe.**\n\n- # UK\n\t- An Enduring Legacy: Unspecified Issues Stemming from Historical Lead Mining in the United Kingdom\n\t\t- [Lake District - Northern Mine Research Society](https://nmrs.org.uk/mines-map/metal/lake-district/)\n\t\t- Introduction: The Enduring Legacy of Britain's Lead Mines\n\t\t\t- Lead mining has shaped the industrial and economic history of the UK. [1]\n\t\t\t- Peak production occurred c. 1750–1850, when Britain was the world’s leading supplier of lead. [1]\n\t\t\t- The North Pennine field (Teesdale, Weardale, South Tynedale, Derwent) was the country’s most important region. [1]\n\t\t\t- Extraction dates back to Roman times and possibly earlier. [1]\n\t\t\t- Industrial Revolution towns required lead for roofing, piping, casting, paints and glazing. [1]\n\t\t\t- Centuries of mining left widespread environmental contamination and complex legacies.\n\t\t\t- “Unspecified issues” encompass persistent pollution, health risks, ecological damage and socio-economic challenges. [4]\n\t\t\t- Abandoned metal mines are the single largest source of metal pollution in English rivers. [4]\n\t\t\t- These issues demand a holistic approach spanning environmental science, toxicology, public health, ecology and socio-economics.\n\t\t\t- The legacy is intergenerational: 18th–19th century mining still poses 21st-century risks. [1][4]\n\t\t\t- Contaminants remain in soils, watercourses and ecosystems, with river-pollution targets set to 2038. [4]\n\t\t\t- “Legacy” signifies transfer of problems from past to present and future, requiring sustained management. [4]\n\t\t\t- Past industrial practices lacked awareness of long-term impacts; today’s generations bear the costs. [2]\n- The Environmental Scar: Contamination from Historic Lead Mining\n\t- Water Contamination: A Pervasive Threat\n\t\t- Mine closures initiated long-term contaminant release, scarring landscapes and ecosystems. [2]\n\t\t- Abandoned metal mines now dominate metal pollution in English rivers and the marine environment. [4]\n\t\t- c. 1 491 km of English rivers/estuaries are polluted by historic mining. [4]\n\t\t- Key contaminants: Pb, Cd, Zn, As, Cu, Ni; iron precipitates turn rivers orange. [4][10]\n\t\t- Point sources: flooded adits drain metal-rich groundwater continuously, especially during low flows. [4][18]\n\t\t- Diffuse sources: spoil heaps leach metals via rain and wind, contaminating sediments kilometres downstream. [4][14]\n\t\t- Examples: Hard and Spence Levels (Barney Beck); pre-2020 Carrshield Tailings Dam. [4][18]\n\t\t- Metal levels often exceed EQS, posing ecotoxicological risk. [17]\n\t\t- Climate change (drier summers, heavier storms) will likely exacerbate contaminants’ concentration and mobilisation. [8][10][21]\n\t\t- Remediation must anticipate altered hydrology and contaminant pathways. [8]\n\t- Soil Contamination: A Persistent Reservoir of Toxins\n\t\t- Mining and smelting wastes deposited on land elevate soil metal concentrations for centuries. [4][11]\n\t\t- Peak District mineralised soils average 2 400 mg/kg Pb; some smelter-proximate samples hit 206 000 mg/kg. [15][23][24]\n\t\t- Spoil heaps leach metals via rainwater, while wind-blown dust spreads contamination metres from source. [4][14]\n\t\t- Vegetables grown on contaminated soils retain excessive lead even after washing. [14]\n\t\t- Residents often unaware until testing reveals dangerous soil levels. [11][15]\n\t\t- Funding gaps leave many high-risk sites unchecked. [11]\n\t\t- Proactive, systematic land assessment is urgently needed to safeguard communities. [11]\n\t- Ecological Impacts: Harming Flora and Fauna\n\t\t- Aquatic life suffers: fish, invertebrates and diatoms show toxicity and structural damage. [4][10][18]\n\t\t- Calaminarian grasslands of metal-tolerant plants have emerged on spoil soils but are climate-vulnerable. [8]\n\t\t- Remediation may destroy these rare habitats, creating a conservation vs decontamination paradox. [8]\n\t\t- Crop yields and livestock health (deaths, lameness) have been impaired by lead exposure. [3][9][11][14]\n\t\t- Mining also caused deforestation, habitat fragmentation and altered watercourses. [7][25]\n\t\t- The legacy blends direct toxicity, landscape alteration and creation of unique ecosystems.\n\t- Overview of Key Historical Lead Mining Regions and Issues  \n\t  | Region                        | Era                        | Examples                       | Issues                                                       |  \n\t  |------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|  \n\t  | North Pennines               | Roman–20th C              | Killhope, Carrshield          | River/soil pollution, landscape scars, woodland decline      |  \n\t  | Yorkshire Dales              | Roman–19th C              | Grinton Mill, Barney Beck     | Polluted rivers, altered flows, diatom damage, spoil heaps   |  \n\t  | Wales                        | Bronze Age–1950           | Minera, Cwmystwyth            | River/soil pollution, livestock health, child poisoning      |  \n\t  | Derbyshire & Peak District   | Roman–19th C              | Odin Mine, Longstone          | River/soil pollution, occupational hazards, grasslands       |  \n\t  | Mendip Hills                 | Roman–20th C              | Charterhouse, Shipham         | River pollution, elevated soil Cd                            |  \n\t  | Leadhills/Wanlockhead        | Pre-17th C–1930s          | Leadhills Mine                | Extreme water/soil contamination, airborne pollution         |  \n\t  | Cornwall                     | Ancient–1991              | Wheal Jane                    | Major pollution incidents, ongoing water treatment           |  \n\t  | Lake District                | Historical                | Force Crag                    | Water pollution, passive treatment                           |\n- Public Health Ramifications: Lead Exposure and Consequences\n\t- Lead is a chronic multi-system toxicant; acute high doses also harmful. [5]\n\t- Developmental neurotoxicity in children has no safe threshold; BLLs ≥ 2 µg/dL reduce IQ. [5][15]\n\t- Cardiovascular, renal, haematological, gastrointestinal, reproductive toxicity and probable carcinogenicity are documented. [5]\n\t- Children absorb up to 53 % of ingested lead vs 5–15 % in adults; pregnant women’s BLLs rise mid-trimester. [5][35]\n\t- UKHSA intervention level is 0.24 µmol/L (5 µg/dL) for children < 16 and pregnant women. [35]\n\t- “No safe level of lead” emphasises need for minimisation. [11]\n\t- Legacy uses (paint, plumbing) continued until recently; public awareness remains low. [6][11]\n\t- Exposure through ingestion (soil, dust, water, food), inhalation (dust) and, less so, dermal contact. [6][9][14][15][24][32][36]\n\t- Child behaviours (hand-to-mouth, pica) heighten risk in contaminated areas. [15][36]\n\t- Case studies: Ceredigion child poisoned; Welsh livestock deaths; high lead in farm eggs. [11][14][29]\n\t- Leadhills risk assessment deemed current risk low with precautions, but contamination and diagnostic difficulty persist. [32][33]\n\t- England-wide study (2014–22) found 340 children with elevated BLLs, soil a major source.

Regulation is well behind thetechnology, to the alarm of some academicobservers.[[rosenberg2022regulation]]\n-\n\t - Abuse; because of the real-time and spatio-temporal abuse happens less like in the current web 2 social media, and more like in the real world, but with less opportunity for repercussions. It might be that natural language processing and machine learning can help with this, but it’s a tough problem. One idea might be to record the speech to text of interactions between participants, and flag to them if a “bullying, harassment, predation threshold” is met. This could be encrypted with the public keys of the participants and a notice sent to them that if they wished to follow up with authorities then they have the necessary attestations and proofs. This is minimally invasive and privacy preserving, and acts as a strong disincentive to repeat offence. It can also feed into a global “web of trust” reputation system in a ‘zero knowledge’ way. Users who flag abuse to the reputation system can leverage the machine learning opinion without revealing what happened (though they would have the data). This would also act as a disincentive without the social stigma issues of reporting.\n- Reporting could be achieved without machine learning identification of potential problems, but there would have to be a social cost to reporting (like gossiping incessantly about others) which would erode the social score of the reporting entity. This would mitigate bot based reputation harm.\n-\n\t - Miscommunication; which as we have seen in the early section of the metaverse chapter is both complex and hard to mitigate\n-\n\t - Lost information\n-\n\t - Distraction\n-\n\t - Jitter, judder, jagginess, and interruption of flow; because the network overhead is higher than other communication media it’s much more exposed to latency effects\n-\n\t - Physical harms, especially to developing brains and ocular systems\n- The UK is [positioning itself](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3137)to heavily regulate safeguarding in the space, with significant fines for non-compliance.

Government deficits add net financial wealth to the private sector. This increases private sector deposits and spending capacity. When people then spend this new money, it stimulates aggregate demand and economic activity. Several empirical examples demonstrate how increasing government deficits leads to higher GDPgrowth and inflation by injecting more money into the real economy.Conversely, austerity policies that reduce deficits, like higher taxes or less spending, destroy private sector financial assets and reduce economic activity. Therefore, government deficits and surpluses have a much more direct impact on the real economy compared to central bank operations that alter the supply of bank reserves.\n\t\t- In their paper for the 2023 central bank meeting at Jackson HoleEichengreen and Arslanalp[[Eichengreen2023]] argue that the 2008 global financial crisis and COVID-19 pandemic have caused public debt levels to balloon to unprecedented heights across advanced, emerging, and developing economies, and that contrary to the calls of major financial institutions, high public debts are unlikely to meaningfully decline in the foreseeable future.\n\t\t- They say this is because the conventional options for debt reduction like running large primary budget surpluses, relying on higher growth rates, or using inflation to erode real debt burdens are politically and economically infeasible today (though AI perhaps offers a slim productivity ‘out’). At the same time, changes in the global financial system like the rise of private creditors have made coordinated debt restructuring more challenging. As a result, the world will have to learn to live with persistently high public debts. This may be manageable for major advanced countries like the US that benefit from structural demand for their safe assets. But it poses greater risks for emerging and developing economies that lack this advantage. Creative solutions like GDP-indexed bonds, credit enhancements, and legal reforms are needed to facilitate sustainable debt restructuring for weaker countries weighed down by debt overhangs. Overall, the shift from bank to bond financing and the changing composition of creditors have reduced options for unwinding high public debts accumulated due to recent crises. It’s a mess.\n\npublic:: true\n\n- Lit survey for [[PEOPLE]] [[David Tully]] [[MUST]] In here for now.\n- {{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhWtpV-ZEeI}}\n- [chat-Sure thing!

Thisis a distributed identity management system that maps Nostr keys toDNS-based internet identifiers. In events of kind 0 (setmetadata), the“nip05” key can have an internet identifier as its value. Clients splitthe identifier into the local part and domain and make a GET request tothe specified URL. The response should be a JSON document with a “names”key containing a mapping of names to hex-formatted public keys. If thepublic key matches the one from the setmetadata event, the clientaccepts the association and considers the “nip05” identifier valid.\n\t\t\t- Clients may find users’ public keys from internet identifiers by firstfetching the well-known URL and then checking for a matching “nip05”.When following public keys, clients must prioritize the keys over NIP-05addresses. Public keys must be in hex format. Clients can enable userdiscovery through search boxes, allowing users to find profiles byentering internet identifiers. The identifier can be used as the “root”identifier, displayed as just the domain. The protocol supports bothdynamic and static servers by using the local part as a query string.\n\t- All this potentially provides a simply interface to the Metaverse, including:\n\t\t- simple cryptographic identity assurance\n\t\t- private peer to peer chat\n\t\t- email to private message relay\n\t\t- links into media on web hosts and [[NosDav]]\n\t- The pace of development on Nostr is dizzying. Peer to peer video and audio will allow us to link metaverse instances, between peers, through applications such as Monstr.\n\t- It’s notable that Nostr has it’s own inexpensive hardware signing device to protect identity in situations where this might be necessary.\n\t- The proposed integration of Nostr social media and messaging, a lightning layer with digital objects such as Fedimint, Zerosync or RGB, AI agents, Vircadia, and federated Bitcoin is the core value proposition of this book. This work pre-dates Meta and Zuckerbergs stated intent in this regard by 18 months, and is differentiated still by our focus on emerging markets and decentralisation.\n\t- NIP-05\n\t\t- At this time, the nascent identity layer in nostr leans on NIP-05. This is a distributed identity management system that maps Nostr keys to DNS-based internet identifiers. In events of kind 0 (setmetadata), the “nip05” key can have an internet identifier as its value. Clients split the identifier into the local part and domain and make a GET request to the specified URL. The response should be a JSON document with a “names” key containing a mapping of names to hex-formatted public keys.

The identifier can be used as the “root” identifier, displayed as just the domain. The protocol supports both dynamic and static servers by using the local part as a query string.\n\t- Nostr Protocol as the keystone\n\t\t- The Nostr protocol can be used to store and share valuable content across the network. This is ably demonstrated by the ‘Highlighter’ project which allows users to store important notes from around the web using nostr. In the context of our federated social media trust model, the Nostr protocol can serve as the underlying layer that connects various instances of virtual spaces, thus enabling seamless data exchange and interoperability among them. Highlighter demonstrates that nostr events can be leveraged to create, store, and interact with valuable across networks. By utilizing this concept, we can extend the functionality to support federated social media trust, allowing users to carry their reputation, identity, and cryptographic proofs across different virtual spaces and social media platforms.\n\t- Nostr marketplace in LnBits\n\t\t- The nostr markets plugin for LnBits allows virtual ‘stalls’ to be setup and payment to be mediated through nostr. This is obviously a great expansion to the usefulness of our integration\n\t- Integrating Cryptographic Proofs and Reputation\n\t\t- To create a trusted environment within the federated network, we must establish a mechanism for importing and verifying cryptographic proofs from various sources, such as social media sites and other digital platforms. By doing so, we enable users to bring their existing reputation and trust from these platforms into the new ecosystem, thus facilitating trust-based interactions and collaboration within the network. We can leverage the Nostr protocol and the NIP05 specification to import these cryptographic proofs, creating a secure and verifiable system for identity management and trust propagation. The NIP05 specification allows for the creation and verification of identity proofs within the Nostr protocol, thus enabling the seamless integration of trust and reputation data from external sources.\n\t- By utilizing the Nostr protocol as the underlying layer, we can establish connections between objects, people, and AI actors within the federated network. This interconnected ecosystem allows for seamless collaboration, information sharing, and trust-based interactions among all participants. The open-source collaboration infrastructure we propose can facilitate the development of various applications and services that leverage the federated network, such as virtual workspaces, AI-assisted creativity tools, and more. The uncensorable nature of this protocol further supports the inclusivity and accessibility we feel so important, ensuring that participants from different regions and backgrounds can take part in the digital society and contribute to its growth.\n\t- This federated social media trust model, built on the Nostr protocol, allows for the establishment of a robust, inclusive, and trust-based network that connects various virtual spaces, social media platforms, and AI systems. By leveraging the lessons learned from the other attempts in the space, and by maximising the inclusion of external cryptographic proofs from multiple sources, we can create a comprehensive trust system that fosters collaboration, innovation, and shared growth within the digital society.\n\t- The Nostr protocol, with its decentralized and open-source nature, provides a solid foundation for linking and federating objects, people, and AI actors across collaborative spaces in digital society. By leveraging the Nostr protocol, we can build a robust and trust-based network that interconnects various virtual spaces, social media platforms, and AI systems. One of the key aspects of this trust-based network is the ability to import cryptographic proofs from different sources, similar to Keybase’s approach to importing proofs from various social media sites (Keybase Proofs).\n\t- StrFry relays\n\t\t- The Stirfry relay software provides high-performance infrastructure for building decentralized social media applications on top of the Noster protocol. As an open source project written in C++, Stirfry emphasizes efficiency, flexibility, and community-driven governance.\n\t\t  At the core of Stirfry is its high-speed database engine. Rather than using a traditional SQL database, Stirfry implements the Lightning Memory-Mapped Database (LMDB)\n\t\t- an embedded key-value store optimized for performance. Reads are lock-free, enabling unlimited parallel query throughput. Writes require only a short-held lock, ensuring minimal interference. LMDB’s \"shadow paging\" design allows isolated read-only transactions via multi-version concurrency control (MVCC). This prevents reads from blocking writes and vice versa.\n\t\t  To maximize database performance, Stirfry stores Noster events directly in FlatBuffers\n\t\t- an efficient binary format allowing direct access without serialization. The original JSON payloads are preserved to facilitate transmission back to clients. Additional database files index events on fields like timestamps and authors, accelerating filter queries. Periodic compaction optimizes the layout for faster operations.\n\t\t- Stirfry adopts a multi-threaded, modular architecture. A websocket thread accepts new client connections and routes incoming requests. An ingester thread validates and pre-processes each request before passing to appropriate handlers. Doing signature checks and filter compilation upfront avoids repeating work. A single writer thread batches database writes to amortize transaction overhead. Multiple worker threads handle read queries, fairly scheduling between long and short requests. Dedicated monitor threads track active filters and stream matching events to subscribed clients. Passing messages between threads instead of sharing data structures improves efficiency.\n\t\t- Additional features further enhance Stirfry’s capabilities. Graceful shutdown support allows stopping new connections while existing ones complete. Hot configuration reloading provides runtime updates without restarting. Flexible write policy plugins enable custom content moderation. Streaming websocket compression and Zstandard dictionaries compress traffic. Syncing protocols like Negentropy facilitate efficient relay replication, powering mesh network topologies. Geo-replication by the relay.org community offers low latency worldwide access. The custom Templar HTML templating library assists crafting simple, fast decentralized frontends.\n\n\t\t- ### Double Ratchet Encryption and Ephemeral Keys:\n\t\t- The core of the new DM spec lies in the double ratchet algorithm, which employs three chains of keys:\n\t\t\t- **Root chain:** Established through an initial Diffie-Hellman key exchange using the participants' Nostr public keys. This creates a shared secret key that serves as the starting point for the ratchet.\n\t\t\t- **Sending chain:** Used for deriving ephemeral keys for encrypting outgoing messages. Each message uses a new ephemeral key, ensuring forward secrecy.\n\t\t\t- **Receiving chain:** Used for deriving ephemeral keys for decrypting incoming messages. The receiving chain ratchets forward upon receiving a message with a new ephemeral key, guaranteeing post-compromise secrecy.\n\npublic:: true\n\n- #Public page automatically published\n\npublic:: true\n\n\npublic:: true\n\n- #Public page\n\t- automatically published\n\npublic:: true\n\n- ![BB1mNtGj.jpeg](assets/BB1mNtGj_1716451730618_0.jpeg)\n- Microsoft are bringing parametric (volume) design to Meta Quest.\n\t- Microsoft is integrating parametric (volume) design capabilities into the Meta Quest platform, enhancing the expressivity of interfaces focused on retrieving and customizing artifacts through extended reality.

Specifically, the painting shows the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam handing over a document to Robert Clive of the East India Company after being defeated at the Battle of Buxar in 1765. The document being transferred granted the East India Company the right to collect taxes (the diwani) in the wealthy Indian provinces of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. This gave the British shareholder Company control over the finances of these regions. Of course the painting is not historically accurate, being what we now know to be 'fake new'. The actual transfer took place in a private tent, with the emperor forced to sign \"with a gun to his head\" after his defeat, rather than in a grand public ceremony as the painting depicts. The artist Benjamin West had also never been to India.\n\t- Though historically inaccurate, this image may capture a truth - that corporate interests, unchecked, can subsume the sovereignty of nations. The East India Company's reign in India was marked by oppression, famine, and the stripping of resources for the benefit of far-off shareholders. It is a stark lesson in the perils of allowing private entities to wield such dominion over people's lives. Companies like Google and Facebook have become the gatekeepers of knowledge, with algorithms that shape what billions of people see and believe. As they develop sophisticated AI models and collect massive amounts of data, are we entrusting them with the modern equivalent of the East India Company's power?\n\t- The diwani painting immortalized a dangerous fiction, the slick PR of Silicon Valley masks the power these firms now command over our minds and societies. The datasets and AI models of these digital colossi are the new currency of truth - and one largely minted behind closed doors. We have seen the consequences again and again:\n\t\t- Tobacco: For decades, Big Tobacco sowed doubt about the dangers of smoking, suppressing research and misleading the public. Millions died as corporate interests trumped scientific truth.\n\t\t- BPA: Chemical companies long insisted BPA plastics were safe, despite mounting evidence of hormone disruption and health risks. Only after massive public pressure did regulators act.\n\t\t- Climate Change: Fossil fuel giants knew the truth about climate change for decades, but funded denial and obfuscation to protect their bottom line. The cost will be borne by generations.\n\t\t- Opioids: Pharmaceutical companies downplayed the addiction risks of opioids, contributing to an epidemic that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. Profits were prioritized over people.\n\t\t- [Don’t rejoice yet, Elon Musk and his tech bros-in-arms are winning the global battle for the truth | Carole Cadwalladr | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/31/elon-musk-x-brazil-telegram-pavel-durov)\n\t- It would be nice to think that we could demand radical transparency, meaningful oversight, and the primacy of public interest over shareholder profits in the construction and deployment of epoch-defining AI.\n\t  One potential solution is the development of open source informational agents.

Otherwise, select another 2 or 3 public-tagged topics and repeat. The process can be attempted a maximum of 10 times. If 10 attempts do not surface a news item of worth, alert the user in the Logseq output.\n\t- **Extract Web Links**: Create a simple list of raw URLs found in the Perplexity response and remove duplicates.\n\t- **Detailed Information Scraping**: Process the identified links using the web scraper module from the models list in OpenWebUI to fetch in-depth summaries and additional content from the linked pages.\n\t- **Or Progress News Item**: Use the GPT4oV model from the OpenWebUI models list to process the raw Perplexity response and all ancillary summaries gathered from the web scraper. Return a detailed and highly technical description of the news item in JSON format, with web URLs and their summaries carefully segmented and linked as a knowledge graph.\n\t- **Enhancing with RAG**: Send the text elements of the GPT4-generated JSON to the RAGflow module in the models list, requesting that the knowledge be modified to include any opinions and ideas from the RAG corpus that intersect with the news item. Save the response to a Logseq block titled # Story Plus RAG.\n\t- **Generating Podcast Script**: Use Claude 3.5 to create a podcast script based on few-shot examples from the Logseq page labelled [[example podcast dialogue]]. Send the RAGflow-enhanced news story and the JSON-structured web links and summaries. The script should alternate dialogue between Bob and Sue, incorporating brief mentions of the web sources available in the episode notes. The returned JSON from Claude 3.5 should have field identifiers for Bob and Sue.\n\t- **Splitting Script**: Divide the podcast script into parts for Bob and Sue, creating two new JSON files with sequence numbers for the conversation.\n\t- **Text to Voice Conversion**: Pass both scripts to text-to-voice engines to generate the audio for Bob and Sue's lines respectively.

Tim Berners Lee (of WWW fame) first mentioned the semantic web in 1999 Mark Berners-Lee Tim; Fischetti. Weaving the web.\n  title:: Semantic Web\n\t- “I have a dream for the Web [in which computers] become capable of analyzing all the data on the Web – the content, links, and transactions between people and computers. A \"Semantic Web\", which makes this possible, has yet to emerge, but when it does, the day-to-day mechanisms of trade, bureaucracy and our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines. The \"intelligent agents\" people have touted for ages will finally materialize.”\n- Attention developed around three core themes, ubiquitous availability and searchability of data, intelligent search assistants, and highly available end points such as phones, and ‘internet of things’ devices. This is certainly manifesting in home devices, but few people think of this as a Web3 revolution. Since ratification of the standards by the World Wide Web (W3C) consortium it seems that their imperative toward decentralisation has become lost. Instead, it can be seen that Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Apple have a harmful oligopoly on users data (Sean S Costigan. World Without Mind:) ()Threat of Big Tech (Franklin Foer). 2018.)\n- This is at odds with Berners-Lee’s vision, and he has recently spoken out about this discrepancy, and attempted to refocus the media onto Web3.0.\n\t- It is worth taking a look at his software implementation called Solid, which is far more mindful of the sovereignty of user data. \n\t  “Solid is an exciting new project led by Prof. Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, taking place at MIT. The project aims to radically change the way Web applications work today, resulting in true data ownership as well as improved privacy. Solid (derived from \"social linked data\") is a proposed set of conventions and tools for building decentralized social applications based on Linked Data principles. Solid is modular and extensible and it relies as much as possible on existing W3C standards and protocols.”\n- Excitement around this kind of differentiated trust model, hinted at in ubiquitous availability of data (and implemented explicitly in Solid), has led to exploration of different paths by cryptographers, and this will be described later. For instance, one of the main developers of Solid, Carvelho, is now a leading developer and propotent of Nostr, another very interesting option which will be described later. This technology space is prolific, but still comparatively young and small.\n-\n\npublic:: true\n\n\t- The concept of the technological singularity has captivated the minds of futurists, technologists, and philosophers for decades.\n- The term \"singularity\" in this context was popularised by mathematician and science fiction author Vernor Vinge in his 1993 essay \"[The Coming Technological Singularity.](https://accelerating.org/articles/comingtechsingularity)\"\n- Vinge's ideas were further expanded upon by inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil in his 2005 book \"The Singularity Is Near.\"\n\npublic:: true\n\n- #Public page automatically published\n- ![ssstwitter.com_1734385624871.mp4](assets/ssstwitter.com_1734385624871_1736679618915_0.mp4)\n\n\t\t- ### Perceptions\n\t\t\t- There are signs of a growing backlash in the public.\n\t\t\t\t- ![image.png](assets/image_1717159768482_0.png)\n\t\t\t\t- ![Screenshot 2024-05-12 201440.png](assets/Screenshot_2024-05-12_201440_1715541399470_0.png){:width 400}\n\t\t\t\t- ![Screenshot 2024-05-12 201210.png](assets/Screenshot_2024-05-12_201210_1715541467566_0.png){:width 300}\n\t\t\t\t- [The bad and the ugly: AI is harmful, unreliable and running out of data (newatlas.com)](https://newatlas.com/technology/ai-index-report-negatives/)\n\t\t\t\t- [AI really is smoke and mirrors - by Brian Merchant (bloodinthemachine.com)](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/ai-really-is-smoke-and-mirrors)\n\t\t\t\t- [The AI Revolution Is Already Losing Steam - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/the-ai-revolution-is-already-losing-steam-a93478b1)\n\t\t\t- {{twitter https://twitter.com/AISafetyMemes/status/1759231062646104165)}}\n\n\t\t- ## The Evolution of Copyright Law\n\t\t\t- Copyright law must evolve to balance creators' rights with public access, especially as AI complicates authorship and ownership ([UK Copyright Legislation](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/artificial-intelligence-and-intellectual-property-call-for-views/artificial-intelligence-call-for-views-copyright-and-related-rights), [US Copyright Act](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/)).\n\npublic:: true\n\n\npublic:: true\n\n- #Public page automatically published\n- Stable Diffusion has emerged as a transformative force in generative AI, mainly for text to image synthesis.

Notable applications include advanced weather forecasting systems like GraphCast and improved material discovery algorithms such as GNoME.  ([Top 10 Takeaways from Stanford’s 2024 AI Index Report](https://www.unite.ai/top-10-takeaways-from-stanfords-ai-index-report-2024/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [The 2024 AI Index Report | Stanford HAI](https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2024-ai-index-report?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\n\t\t- ## Wallets, seeds, keys and BIP39\n\t - In all the cryptographic systems described in this book everything isderived from a private key. This is an enormous number, and the input tothe trapdoor function described earlier. As usual, it’s beyond the scopeof this book to ‘rehash’ the detail. Prof Bill Buchanan OBE has a [greatpost](https://medium.com/asecuritysite-when-bob-met-alice/can-i-derive-the-private-key-from-the-public-key-ba3609256ec)on the basic version of this process.\n\t - In modern wallets, private keys (and so too their public keys), andaddresses, are generated hierarchically. This is all part of[BIP-0032](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki).It starts with a single [monstrouslylarge](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=2%5E512) number of up to 512bits. From this are crafted Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets,which use ‘derivation paths’ to make a tree of public/private key pairs,all seeded from this first number. This means that knowing the initialnumber, and the derivation path applied to it (just another number),wallets can search down the tree of derivations and find all thepossible addresses. In this way a whole group of active addressesbelonging to an entity can be held conveniently in one huge number (aconcatenation of the input and path). This is the seed. Seeds are evenmore conveniently abstracted into a mnemonic called a seed phrase.Anyone interacting with these systems will see a 12 word (128 bits ofentropy which is considered to be[‘enough’](https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1433375602808066049)) or24 word (256 bit) seed phrase. That phrase accesses the whole of theassets stored by that entity in the blockchain under it. A master key.These seeds can be [generated byhand](https://vault12.com/securemycrypto/cryptocurrency-security-how-to/dice-crypto-recovery-seed/)with dice, remember it’s just a huge number and the onward cryptographyat play here.\n\t\t\t\t\t- **Easter Egg Hunts in Social Metaverses**: The color-based representation of BIP39 seeds opens up opportunities for creative and engaging experiences in metaverse environments. For instance, mnemonic seeds could be hidden within digital artifacts in the form of color sequences. These could be used as treasure hunts or easter eggs, potentially carrying real-world value in the form of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Recovery would mean some kind of sampling as in Fig <a href=\"#fig:HDwalletBlock\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"fig:HDwalletBlock\">3.12</a> and software.\n\t\t\t\t\t- **Provenance Encoding in Digital Art**: The mnemonic color-coding could be embedded within digital art pieces, effectively encoding the provenance of the artwork directly into its visual representation. This could add an extra layer of security and uniqueness to the art piece, and also serve as a novel way of proving ownership or creatorship.\n\t\t\t\t\t- **Steganographic Transfer of Funds**: By incorporating the color-encoded BIP39 seeds into various aspects of a metaverse or digital environment, they can serve as a form of steganography. This allows for the transfer of funds or sensitive information covertly within the visual and experiential components of the environment.\n\t\t\t\t\t- **Gamification of Cryptographic Keys**: Cryptographic keys are typically represented as long, random strings of characters that are hard to remember and not very user-friendly. Representing these keys as a sequence of colors could make them more approachable and memorable. This could also introduce an aspect of gamification into the world of identity and value, possibly increasing their appeal to a broader audience.\n\t - **BIP39Colors**: A class that contains a list of BIP39 words and methods to convert a hexadecimal seed to RGB colors and mnemonic words.\n-\n\t - **hex\\_to\\_rgb**: A static method within the BIP39Colors class that converts a hexadecimal color to an RGB color.\n-\n- The output of the program is a GLB file, which is a binary file formatrepresentation of 3D models saved in the GL Transmission Format (glTF).The file \"model.glb\" will be created in the same directory as thescript.\n- <span class=\"image\">This is the nostr pubkey for flossverse, encodedinto the far larger HD wallet space (hence the muted colours) and thendisplayed as blocks.</span>\n\n\t\t- ### Geopolitics\n\t\t\t- It can be seen that following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, that sanctions of various kinds were applied to the Russian economy. One of these was the previously discussed Swift international settlement network. Another whole category was the removal of support by private businesses domiciled outside of Russia and Ukraine, and pertinent here is that VISA, Mastercard, Paypal, and Western Union all removed support for their product rails. This means that while some cards and services still work, and will likely work again through Chinese proxies in the coming months, considerable disruption will be felt by Russian companies and individuals. This is not to say that this disruption is necessarily wrong, but it is clear now that all of these global financial transfer products and services are contingent on political factors. The same might be true of CBDC products if they gain traction globally. There is certainly no reason why all money within a physically delineated border could not be blocked or cancelled. This is not as true for Bitcoin at this time.\n\t\t\t- However, with enough political will it is technically plausible to incentivise miners with additional payments to exclude transactions from geolocated wallets. This would be mitigated by Tor, and in a global anonymous network it is very likely that a miner could be found at a higher price for inclusion in the next block.\n\t\t\t- We have already seen much negative political positioning related to the energy concerns in an earlier chapter. There are similar noises coming from policy makers with regard to the money utility of the technology. The United Nations [have made the following recommendations](https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/presspb2022d8_en.pdf):\n\t\t\t\t- “Developing countries may have less room to manoeuvre, yet the regulation of cryptocurrencies is possible. The following policies, among others, have the potential to curb the further spread of the risks of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins:\n\t\t\t\t\t- Ensuring comprehensive financial regulation, through the following actions:\n\t\t\t\t\t- Require the mandatory registration of crypto-exchanges and digital wallets and make the use of cryptocurrencies less attractive, for example by charging entry fees for crypto-exchanges and digital wallets and/or imposing financial transaction taxes on cryptocurrency trading;\n\t\t\t\t\t- Ban regulated financial institutions from holding stablecoins and cryptocurrencies or offering related products to clients;\n\t\t\t\t\t- Regulate decentralized finance (such finance may, in fact, not be fully decentralized, given its central management and ownership, which form an entry point for regulation);\n\t\t\t\t\t- Restricting or prohibiting the advertisement of crypto-exchanges and digital wallets in public spaces and on social media. This new type of virtual, and often disguised, advertisement requires policymakers to expand the scope of regulation beyond traditional media. This is an urgent need in terms of consumer protection in countries with low levels of financial literacy, as even limited exposure to cryptocurrencies may lead to significant losses;\n\t\t\t\t\t- Creating a public payment system to serve as a public good, such as a central bank digital currency. In the light of the regulatory and technological complexity of central bank digital currencies and the urgent need to provide safe, reliable and affordable payment systems, authorities could also examine other possibilities, including fast retail payment systems.\n\t\t\t- This is tough talk. We have seen that the IMF is willing to make theirloans contingent on such regulation, and are increasingly [talking about banning](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/02/23/pr2351-imf-executive-board-discusses-elements-of-effective-policies-for-crypto-assets) the technology.

Thisis a distributed identity management system that maps Nostr keys toDNS-based internet identifiers. In events of kind 0 (setmetadata), the“nip05” key can have an internet identifier as its value. Clients splitthe identifier into the local part and domain and make a GET request tothe specified URL. The response should be a JSON document with a “names”key containing a mapping of names to hex-formatted public keys. If thepublic key matches the one from the setmetadata event, the clientaccepts the association and considers the “nip05” identifier valid.\n\t\t\t- Clients may find users’ public keys from internet identifiers by firstfetching the well-known URL and then checking for a matching “nip05”.When following public keys, clients must prioritize the keys over NIP-05addresses. Public keys must be in hex format. Clients can enable userdiscovery through search boxes, allowing users to find profiles byentering internet identifiers. The identifier can be used as the “root”identifier, displayed as just the domain. The protocol supports bothdynamic and static servers by using the local part as a query string.\n\t- All this potentially provides a simply interface to the Metaverse, including:\n\t\t- simple cryptographic identity assurance\n\t\t- private peer to peer chat\n\t- It’s notable that Nostr has it’s own inexpensive hardware signing device to protect identity in situations where this might be necessary.\n\t- The proposed integration of Nostr social media and messaging, a lightning layer with digital objects such as Fedimint, Zerosync or RGB, AI agents, Vircadia, and federated Bitcoin is the core value proposition of this book. This work pre-dates Meta and Zuckerbergs stated intent in this regard by 18 months, and is differentiated still by our focus on emerging markets and decentralisation.\n\t- NIP-05\n\t\t- At this time, the nascent identity layer in nostr leans on NIP-05.

The identifier can be used as the “root” identifier, displayed as just the domain. The protocol supports both dynamic and static servers by using the local part as a query string.\n\t- Nostr Protocol as the keystone\n\t\t- The Nostr protocol can be used to store and share valuable content across the network. This is ably demonstrated by the ‘Highlighter’ project which allows users to store important notes from around the web using nostr. In the context of our federated social media trust model, the Nostr protocol can serve as the underlying layer that connects various instances of virtual spaces, thus enabling seamless data exchange and interoperability among them. Highlighter demonstrates that nostr events can be leveraged to create, store, and interact with valuable across networks. By utilizing this concept, we can extend the functionality to support federated social media trust, allowing users to carry their reputation, identity, and cryptographic proofs across different virtual spaces and social media platforms.\n\t\t- The nostr markets plugin for LnBits allows virtual ‘stalls’ to be setup and payment to be mediated through nostr. This is obviously a great expansion to the usefulness of our integration\n\t- By utilizing the Nostr protocol as the underlying layer, we can establish connections between objects, people, and AI actors within the federated network. This interconnected ecosystem allows for seamless collaboration, information sharing, and trust-based interactions among all participants. The open-source collaboration infrastructure we propose can facilitate the development of various applications and services that leverage the federated network, such as virtual workspaces, AI-assisted creativity tools, and more. The uncensorable nature of this protocol further supports the inclusivity and accessibility we feel so important, ensuring that participants from different regions and backgrounds can take part in the digital society and contribute to its growth.\n\t- This federated social media trust model, built on the Nostr protocol, allows for the establishment of a robust, inclusive, and trust-based network that connects various virtual spaces, social media platforms, and AI systems. By leveraging the lessons learned from the other attempts in the space, and by maximising the inclusion of external cryptographic proofs from multiple sources, we can create a comprehensive trust system that fosters collaboration, innovation, and shared growth within the digital society.\n\t\t  At the core of Stirfry is its high-speed database engine. Rather than using a traditional SQL database, Stirfry implements the Lightning Memory-Mapped Database (LMDB)\n\t\t- an embedded key-value store optimized for performance. Reads are lock-free, enabling unlimited parallel query throughput. Writes require only a short-held lock, ensuring minimal interference. LMDB’s \"shadow paging\" design allows isolated read-only transactions via multi-version concurrency control (MVCC). This prevents reads from blocking writes and vice versa.\n\t\t  To maximize database performance, Stirfry stores Noster events directly in FlatBuffers\n\t\t\t- **Client adoption:** The success of the new DM spec hinges on its implementation across various Nostr clients. Developers need to integrate the necessary cryptographic functions and session management logic.\n\t\t\t- **Device syncing:** Syncing conversations across multiple devices and clients poses a significant challenge due to the lack of a central server. Potential solutions involve broadcasting messages to multiple sessions and managing separate inboxes for each session.\n\t\t\t- **User experience:** The complexity of the double ratchet system and the potential for out-of-order messages may require careful design considerations to ensure a seamless user experience.\n\n#Public page automatically published\n\n\t\t- Established standards, struggles to quantify impact, and relies heavily on the judgement of private companies.\n\t\t- Trust and safety (T&S) emerged as a field to govern risks in online communities. It became crucial as user-generated content platforms scaled.\n\t- This painting is called \"The Shah Alam conveying the gift of the Dewani to Lord Clive\" and depicts a supposed key moment in the East India Company taking control of Indian territory. Specifically, the painting shows the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam handing over a document to Robert Clive of the East India Company after being defeated at the Battle of Buxar in 1765. The document being transferred granted the East India Company the right to collect taxes (the diwani) in the wealthy Indian provinces of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. This gave the British shareholder Company control over the finances of these regions. Of course the painting is not historically accurate, being what we now know to be 'fake new'. The actual transfer took place in a private tent, with the emperor forced to sign \"with a gun to his head\" after his defeat, rather than in a grand public ceremony as the painting depicts. The artist Benjamin West had also never been to India.\n\t- Though historically inaccurate, this image may capture a truth - that corporate interests, unchecked, can subsume the sovereignty of nations. The East India Company's reign in India was marked by oppression, famine, and the stripping of resources for the benefit of far-off shareholders. It is a stark lesson in the perils of allowing private entities to wield such dominion over people's lives. Companies like Google and Facebook have become the gatekeepers of knowledge, with algorithms that shape what billions of people see and believe. As they develop sophisticated AI models and collect massive amounts of data, are we entrusting them with the modern equivalent of the East India Company's power?\n\t- The diwani painting immortalized a dangerous fiction, the slick PR of Silicon Valley masks the power these firms now command over our minds and societies. The datasets and AI models of these digital colossi are the new currency of truth - and one largely minted behind closed doors. We have seen the consequences again and again:\n\t\t- Tobacco: For decades, Big Tobacco sowed doubt about the dangers of smoking, suppressing research and misleading the public. Millions died as corporate interests trumped scientific truth.\n\t\t- BPA: Chemical companies long insisted BPA plastics were safe, despite mounting evidence of hormone disruption and health risks. Only after massive public pressure did regulators act.\n\t\t- Climate Change: Fossil fuel giants knew the truth about climate change for decades, but funded denial and obfuscation to protect their bottom line. The cost will be borne by generations.\n\t\t- Opioids: Pharmaceutical companies downplayed the addiction risks of opioids, contributing to an epidemic that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. Profits were prioritized over people.\n\t\t- [Don’t rejoice yet, Elon Musk and his tech bros-in-arms are winning the global battle for the truth | Carole Cadwalladr | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/31/elon-musk-x-brazil-telegram-pavel-durov)\n\t- It would be nice to think that we could demand radical transparency, meaningful oversight, and the primacy of public interest over shareholder profits in the construction and deployment of epoch-defining AI.\n\t  One potential solution is the development of open source informational agents. These AI systems, built transparently and collaboratively by the global community, could serve as a counterweight to corporate and state-controlled narratives. This is not a trivial undertaking.\n\n\t- #### Technological Influence and Governance\n\t\t- **Anti-Scale Philosophy**: Wikipedia operates through micro-communities, allowing for diverse expertise and governance continuity.\n\t\t- **Democratic Governance**: The need for democratic governance to articulate its value proposition for public participation.\n\n\t\t- ## Nominated Agents\n\t\t\t- Web Search\n\t\t\t\t- ```text\n\t\t\t\t  Perplexity\n\t\t\t\t  ```\n\t\t\t- Rating the news\n\t\t\t\t- ```text\n\t\t\t\t  Mistral 8B\n\t\t\t\t  ```\n- **Loading Topics**: Search the logseq knowledge graph for the tagged public pages.

([Top 10 Takeaways from Stanford’s 2024 AI Index Report](https://www.unite.ai/top-10-takeaways-from-stanfords-ai-index-report-2024/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [The 2024 AI Index Report | Stanford HAI](https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2024-ai-index-report?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\n\t\t- ### Geopolitics\n\t\t\t- It can be seen that following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, that sanctions of various kinds were applied to the Russian economy. One of these was the previously discussed Swift international settlement network. Another whole category was the removal of support by private businesses domiciled outside of Russia and Ukraine, and pertinent here is that VISA, Mastercard, Paypal, and Western Union all removed support for their product rails. This means that while some cards and services still work, and will likely work again through Chinese proxies in the coming months, considerable disruption will be felt by Russian companies and individuals. This is not to say that this disruption is necessarily wrong, but it is clear now that all of these global financial transfer products and services are contingent on political factors. The same might be true of CBDC products if they gain traction globally. There is certainly no reason why all money within a physically delineated border could not be blocked or cancelled. This is not as true for Bitcoin at this time.\n\t\t\t- However, with enough political will it is technically plausible to incentivise miners with additional payments to exclude transactions from geolocated wallets. This would be mitigated by Tor, and in a global anonymous network it is very likely that a miner could be found at a higher price for inclusion in the next block.\n\t\t\t- We have already seen much negative political positioning related to the energy concerns in an earlier chapter. There are similar noises coming from policy makers with regard to the money utility of the technology. The United Nations [have made the following recommendations](https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/presspb2022d8_en.pdf):\n\t\t\t\t- “Developing countries may have less room to manoeuvre, yet the regulation of cryptocurrencies is possible. The following policies, among others, have the potential to curb the further spread of the risks of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins:\n\t\t\t\t\t- Ensuring comprehensive financial regulation, through the following actions:\n\t\t\t\t\t- Require the mandatory registration of crypto-exchanges and digital wallets and make the use of cryptocurrencies less attractive, for example by charging entry fees for crypto-exchanges and digital wallets and/or imposing financial transaction taxes on cryptocurrency trading;\n\t\t\t\t\t- Ban regulated financial institutions from holding stablecoins and cryptocurrencies or offering related products to clients;\n\t\t\t\t\t- Regulate decentralized finance (such finance may, in fact, not be fully decentralized, given its central management and ownership, which form an entry point for regulation);\n\t\t\t\t\t- Restricting or prohibiting the advertisement of crypto-exchanges and digital wallets in public spaces and on social media. This new type of virtual, and often disguised, advertisement requires policymakers to expand the scope of regulation beyond traditional media. This is an urgent need in terms of consumer protection in countries with low levels of financial literacy, as even limited exposure to cryptocurrencies may lead to significant losses;\n\t\t\t\t\t- Creating a public payment system to serve as a public good, such as a central bank digital currency. In the light of the regulatory and technological complexity of central bank digital currencies and the urgent need to provide safe, reliable and affordable payment systems, authorities could also examine other possibilities, including fast retail payment systems.\n\t\t\t- This is tough talk. We have seen that the IMF is willing to make theirloans contingent on such regulation, and are increasingly [talking about banning](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/02/23/pr2351-imf-executive-board-discusses-elements-of-effective-policies-for-crypto-assets) the technology. This global response to the technology is a significant headwind, but like the internet itself, it’s very hard to actually stop these products being used.\n\n\t\t- #### What’s in a DID document?\n\t\t- All classic DID is underpinned by a DID document what bootstrap theservices it’s connected to.

In the context of LED wall virtual production, pre-viz\n- The LED wall virtual production process typically involves using a\n  combination of 3D animation software, motion capture technology, and\n  real-time rendering to create a virtual environment that accurately\n  reflects the physical environment in which the scene will be shot. The\n  pre-viz process is then used to plan and test the various visual\n  effects, lighting, and camera angles that will be used in the final\n  production.\n- Our collaborative software stack is potentially ideally suited to some\n  of this pre-viz work, especially when combined with the power of machine\n  learning, and live linked into Unreal so that changes by stakeholders\n  enter the pre-production pipeline in a seamless way.\n\t\t  neoliberalism itself is to blame. He says  \n\t\t  it“It is the contention of this book that 21st-century culture is marked\n\t\t  by the same anachronism and inertia which afflicted Sapphire and Steel\n\t\t  in their final adventure. But this status has been buried, interred\n\t\t  behind a superficial frenzy of ‘newness’, of perpetual movement. The\n\t\t  ‘jumbling up of time’, the montaging of earlier eras, has ceased to be\n\t\t  worthy of comment; it is now so prevalent that it is no longer even\n\t\t  noticed.”\n\t\t- It is the feeling of the authors of this book that the creative and\n\t\t  inspirational efforts of the whole world may be needed to heal these\n\t\t  deep wounds. It is possible that by connecting creatives with very\n\t\t  different global perspectives, directly into ‘Western’ production\n\t\t  pipelines, that we will be able to see the shape of this potential.\n\t\t- We will base our identity and object management on Nostr public/private\n\t\t  key pairs. The public key of these enable lightning based exchange of\n\t\t  value globally. we plan to operate Nostr in multiple modes. Linking\n\t\t  flossverse “rooms” will be a Nostr bot to bot system within the private\n\t\t  relay mesh. This can also synchronise large amounts of data by\n\t\t  leveraging torrents [negotiated by Nostr](https://iris.to/#/settings).\n\n- ## [[Politics, Law, Privacy]]\n\t- EU AI act is it'll be near impossible now for small disruptive companies to train foundation models because of the administration overhead. Win for America.\n\t- Governments can now use real-time biometric surveillance in public spaces in prevention of genuine, present, or foreseeable threats, and searches for people suspected of the most serious crimes, so basically everything.\n\t\t- \"Real-time’ remote biometric identification (RBI) in publicly accessible spaces is prohibited for law enforcement, except when: searching for missing persons, abduction victims, and people who have been human trafficked or sexually exploited; preventing substantial and imminent threat to life, or foreseeable terrorist attack; or identifying suspects in serious crimes (e.g., murder, rape, armed robbery, narcotic and illegal weapons trafficking, organised crime, and environmental crime, etc.).\"\n\t\t- But any use of AI requires caution and humility. One of AI's prominent applications made headlines this year for a shortcoming known as \"hallucination,\" which caused the lawyers using the application to submit briefs with citations to non-existent cases. (Always a bad idea.) Some legal scholars have raised concerns about whether entering confidential information into an AI tool might compromise later attempts to invoke legal privileges. In criminal cases, the use of AI in assessing flight risk, recidivism, and other largely discretionary decisions that involve predictions has generated concerns about due process, reliability, and potential bias. At least at present, studies show a persistent public perception of a \"human-AI fairness gap,\" reflecting the view that human adjudications, for all of their flaws, are fairer than whatever the machine spits out.\n\t\t- Many professional tennis tournaments, including the US Open, have replaced line judges with optical technology to determine whether 130 mile per hour serves are in or out. These decisions involve precision to the millimeter. And there is no discretion; the ball either did or did not hit the line. By contrast, legal determinations often involve gray areas that still require application of human judgment.\n\t\t- Machines cannot fully replace key actors in court. Judges, for example, measure the sincerity of a defendant's allocution at sentencing. Nuance matters: Much can turn on a shaking hand, a quivering voice, a change of inflection, a bead of sweat, a moment's hesitation, a fleeting break in eye contact. And most people still trust humans more than machines to perceive and draw the right inferences from these clues.\n\t\t- Appellate judges, too, perform quintessentially human functions. Many appellate decisions turn on whether a lower court has abused its discretion, a standard that by its nature involves fact-specific gray areas. Others focus on open questions about how the law should develop in new areas. AI is based largely on existing information, which can inform but not make such decisions.\n\t\t- Rule 1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure directs the parties and the courts to seek the \"just, speedy, and inexpensive\" resolution of cases. Many AI applications indisputably assist the judicial system in advancing those goals. As AI evolves, courts will need to consider its proper uses in litigation. In the federal courts, several Judicial Conference Committees—including those dealing with court administration and case management, cybersecurity, and the rules of practice and procedure, to name just a few—will be involved in that effort. I am glad that they will be.\n\t\t- I predict that human judges will be around for a while. But with equal confidence I predict that judicial work—particularly at the trial level—will be significantly affected by AI. Those changes will involve not only how judges go about doing their job, but also how they understand the role that AI plays in the cases that come before them.\n\n- ### Public page automatically published\n- ![1721832527031.jpeg](assets/1721832527031_1721833836065_0.jpeg)\n\t- [This is a jargon free primer](https://www.understandingai.org/p/large-language-models-explained-with)\n\n- ## Web 4.0\n  The EU has released it's [positional thinking](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3718) on Web 4.

For instance the ideal meeting size is 6, and this is naturally established in work settings. This has not translated into a metaverse setting where dozens of people routinely crash across one another. In the context of supporting a creative “backstage” world where set planning, production shots, etc can be discussed we believe we have solutions which will get the best out of distributed teams of film-makers. Leveraging the world’s most powerful decentralised computing network to create scale and security without high cost The Bitcoin network is more than just a speculative money like asset, it is the most secure distributed computing system ever built. We can jump on the back of this at almost no cost to enable scale for transfer of value, trust, and digital assets of provenance. Cryptographically assured end points With the cryptography tools provided through integration of the Bitcoin network we can also use non-blockchain based secure messaging, and identity proofs. Micro transactions in collaborative spaces New tooling the space allows fractions of a pound or dollar to be exchanged between parties across the world. This means that work can be paid “by the second” both inside and outside of the metaverse. This radically improves creative microtask workflows. World leading open source machine learning and bot architectures By integrating Stablity AI tools for image generation, video processing, natural language, and speech to text / text to speech we hope to reduce friction within the backstage worlds. Creating a narrative arrow from a remote director/producer/DP, through a VP screen into a shoot, and back into a persistent metaverse shared with the public By linking across these new systems with world class telepresence research we hope to use a single digital context to support senior stakeholders, creatives, technical teams, and the wider public. New paths to monetisation and digital ownership This unified digital back end is optimised for flows of money, trust, and digital objects. This is a new area for VP.

Digital assets can be bought from the set.\n\n- ### Public page automatically published\n- ![1721832527031.jpeg](assets/1721832527031_1721833836065_0.jpeg)\n\n- ##### NIP-05\n- At this time, the nascent identity layer in nostr leans on NIP-05. Thisis a distributed identity management system that maps Nostr keys toDNS-based internet identifiers. In events of kind 0 (setmetadata), the“nip05” key can have an internet identifier as its value. Clients splitthe identifier into the local part and domain and make a GET request tothe specified URL. The response should be a JSON document with a “names”key containing a mapping of names to hex-formatted public keys. If thepublic key matches the one from the setmetadata event, the clientaccepts the association and considers the “nip05” identifier valid.\n- Clients may find users’ public keys from internet identifiers by firstfetching the well-known URL and then checking for a matching “nip05”.When following public keys, clients must prioritize the keys over NIP-05addresses. Public keys must be in hex format. Clients can enable userdiscovery through search boxes, allowing users to find profiles byentering internet identifiers. The identifier can be used as the “root”identifier, displayed as just the domain. The protocol supports bothdynamic and static servers by using the local part as a query string.\n\n- ### Federated social media trust\n- This section about newer technologies is perhaps best [summarised byJackDorsey](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/jackjack/issues/a-native-internet-protocol-for-social-media-1503112?via=twitter-card&client=DesktopWeb&element=issue-card),ex CEO of twitter, paraphrased here:  it\n- “I’ll start with the principles I’ve come to believe based on everythingI’ve learned and experienced through my past actions as a Twitterco-founder and Lead:\n-\n\t- Social media must be resilient to corporate and government control.\n-\n\t- Only the original author may remove content they produce.\n-\n\t- Moderation is best implemented by algorithmic choice.\n- The biggest mistake I made was continuing to invest in building toolsfor us to manage the public conversation versus building tools for thepeople using Twitter to easily manage it for themselves this burdenedthe company with too much power and opened us to significant outsidepressure such as advertising budgets. I generally think companies havebecome far too powerful. The only way I know of to truly live up tothese three principles is a free and open protocol for social media thatis not owned by a single company or group of companies and is resilientto corporate and government influence the problem today is that we havecompanies who own both the protocol and discovery of content whichultimately puts one person in charge of what’s available and seen or notthis is by definition a single point of failure no matter how great theperson and over time will fracture the public conversation and may leadto more control by governments and corporations around the world.\n- The following technologies were selected for this book long beforeDorsey wrote those words, but they itare the technologies in which he isinvesting his time and money to further those 3 principles. Keybase isan interesting example of how proofs ont he internet can lean upon oneanother to provide a corpus of trusts. It provides a model of [importingproofs](https://book.keybase.io/account#proofs) from various socialmedia sites. This allows importing of reputation into new ecosystems.\n\n- ##### What’s in a DID document?\n- All classic DID is underpinned by a DID document what bootstrap theservices it’s connected to. It is made up of one or more public keys.The documents can make use of services such as timestamps, cryptographicsignatures, proofs, delegations, and authorisations. They should containthe minimum amount of information to accomplish the specific taskrequired of them.\n\n- ### Classic DID/SSI\n- Distributed identity / self sovereign identity has been extensivelyresearched for decades, with hundreds of peer reviewed papers, andextensive support from the [world wide webconsortium](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/). The academic field nowseems quite ossified and has settled on a couple of hundred ‘schema’which they feel underpin the next layer of development. It is a [complexfield](https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/overview-of-decentralized-identity-standards-f82efd9ab6c7),and the language and diagrams are arcane and self referential as seen inFigure<a href=\"#fig:DID\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"fig:DID\">5.1</a>.\n- <span class=\"image\">Part of the DID SSI specs</span>\n- . Moreover the minimal implementation of such proposed systems hints ata [federated model](https://www.w3.org/community/perma-id/) of[centralised/federated‘truth’](https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-model/issues/947#issuecomment-1276186406)to enable persistence of identifiers over time.  The major failing of the DID/SSI work to date is a lack of meaningfuluse cases with incentives for adoption. This is clearly explained byLockwood[[lockwood2021exploring]] who proposes that the pathway toadoption of ‘classic’ DID/SSI requires an incentive over and above thecurrent identity management on the web. Being distributed is not enough.Especially in the light of questionable assurances of this even beingtrue.  Perhaps most concerning is this [recentexchange](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2022Mar/thread.html)on the mailing lists. Here, two long standing developers of DID say thefollowing:  it“Not a single entity I know that’s doing production deployments hasactually vetted did:ion and found it to be production capable. This goesfor every DLT-based DID Method out there\n\t- even the one we’re workingon. I am highly sceptical of anyone that says that any DID Method isready for production usage at present.  Agreed — as one of the proponents of DLTs (in particular permissionlesspublic ones) none are mature enough yet for production.”. It seems thenthat we can rule out use of these technologies?\n\n- ## Classic DID/SSI\n\t- Distributed identity / self sovereign identity has been extensivelyresearched for decades, with hundreds of peer reviewed papers, andextensive support from the [world wide webconsortium](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).

This has come pretty much out of nowhere but seems highly relevant to us if it sticks. From the text: Here is the bullet point list in LaTeX:\n\t- [Empowering people and reinforcing skills]  to     foster awareness, access to trustworthy information and build a     talent pool of virtual world specialists. By the end of 2023, the     Commission will promote the guiding principles for virtual worlds,     put forward by the Citizens' Panel; and will develop guidance for     the general public thanks to a 'Citizen toolbox' by the first     quarter of 2024. As specialists on virtual worlds are essential, the     Commission will work with Member States to set up a talent pipeline     and will support skills development, including for women and girls,     through projects funded by the Digital Europe Programme, and for     creators of digital content through the Creative Europe programme.     [Business: supporting a European Web 4.0 industrial     ecosystem]  to scale up excellence and address     fragmentation. Currently, there is no EU ecosystem bringing together     the different players of the value chain of virtual worlds and Web     4.0. The Commission has proposed a candidate Partnership on Virtual     Worlds under Horizon Europe, possibly starting 2025, to foster     excellence in research and develop an industrial and technological     roadmap for virtual worlds. To foster innovation, the Commission     will also support EU creators and media companies to test new     creation tools, bring together developers and industrial users, and     work with Member States to develop regulatory sandboxes for Web 4.0     and virtual worlds.     [Government: supporting societal progress and virtual public     services]  to leverage the opportunities     virtual worlds can offer. The EU is already investing in major     initiatives, such as Destination Earth (DestinE), Local Digital     Twins for smart communities, or the European Digital Twin of the     Ocean to allow researchers to advance science, industries to develop     precision applications and public authorities to make informed     public-policy decisions. The Commission is launching two new public     flagships: \"CitiVerse\", an immersive urban environment that can be     used for city planning and management; and a European Virtual Human     Twin, which will replicate the human body to support clinical     decisions and personal treatment.     [Shaping global standards for open and interoperable virtual worlds     and Web 4.0,]  ensuring that they will not be     dominated by a few big players. The Commission will engage with     internet governance stakeholders around the world and will promote     Web 4.0 standards in line with the EU's vision and values.\n\n- ## Concerns Over AI's Influence on Online Content\n\t- The collective impact of these developments creates a potentially more precarious environment for the manipulation of public opinion through artificial intelligence (AI). As political discourse becomes decentralized across various platforms and the emphasis on political content diminishes on major social media platforms, there is a growing risk of AI being exploited to manipulate public sentiment and political narratives.\n\t- Europol raised concerns about AI's overwhelming presence in online content ([reference](https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/europol-sounds-alarm-on-ai-in-online-content-slamming-tech-giants/)).\n\t- Experts warn internet is saturated with bots, [disinformation](https://counterhate.com/research/the-disinformation-dozen/) and biases that undermine perceptions of genuine interactions ([reference](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajdellinger/2019/04/24/the-bots-that-are-changing-reddit/?sh=7d6d25b94e23)).\n\t- The internet is becoming balkanised as large data aggregators like reddit close their APIs and prevent scraping. This is already having a meaningful effect on internet search.\n\t- 'Background tokens' is a term used on the [[latent space]] podcast to describe pre LLM unpolluted data. This legacy data is the last state of human discourse.\n\t- A fascinating unexpected second order impact of this is that future models may skew more right wing as those sites [welcome the scraping.](https://www.wired.com/story/most-news-sites-block-ai-bots-right-wing-media-welcomes-them/?)\n\t- [AI and Leviathan: Part III by Samuel Hammond (secondbest.ca)](https://www.secondbest.ca/p/ai-and-leviathan-part-iii)\n\n- ### Public page automatically published\n- ![1721832527031.jpeg](assets/1721832527031_1721833836065_0.jpeg)\n\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
