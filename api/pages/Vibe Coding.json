Reference it constantly. • AI loses context fast — this is your compass.\n  \n  2. Add a deployment manual. Yesterday.\n  \n  Document exactly how to ship your project. Which branch, which env vars, which server, where the bodies are buried.\n  \n  You will forget. Cursor will forget. This file saves you at 2am.\n  \n  3. Git or die trying.\n  \n  Cursor will break something critical.\n  \n  • Use version control. • Use local changelogs per folder (frontend/backend). • Saves tokens and gives your AI breadcrumbs to follow.\n  \n  4. Short chats > Smart chats\n  \n  Don’t hoard one 400-message Cursor chat. Start new ones per issue.\n  \n  • Keep context small, scoped, and aggressive. • Always say: “Fix X only. Don’t change anything else.” • AI is smart, but it’s also a toddler with scissors.\n  \n  5. Don’t touch anything until you’ve scoped the feature\n  \n  Your AI works better when you plan.\n  \n  • Write out the full feature flow in GPT/Claude first. • Get suggestions. • Choose one approach. • Then go to Cursor. You’re not brainstorming in Cursor. You’re executing.\n  \n  6. Clean your house weekly\n  \n  Run a weekly codebase cleanup.\n  \n  • Delete temp files. • Reorganize folder structure. • AI thrives in clean environments. So do you.\n  \n  7. Don’t ask Cursor to build the whole thing\n  \n  It’s not your intern. It’s a tool. Use it for: • UI stubs • Small logic blocks • Controlled refactors\n  \n  Asking for an entire app in one go is like asking a blender to cook your dinner.\n  \n  8. Ask before you fix\n  \n  When debugging: • Ask the model to investigate first. • Then have it suggest multiple solutions. • Then pick one.\n  \n  Only then ask it to implement. This sequence saves you hours of recursive hell.\n  \n  9. Tech debt builds at AI speed\n  \n  You’ll MVP fast, but the mess scales faster than you.\n  \n  • Keep architecture clean. • Pause every few sprints to refactor. • You can vibe-code fast, but you can’t scale spaghetti.\n  \n  10. Your job is to lead the machine\n  \n  Cursor isn’t “coding for you.” It’s co-piloting. You’re still the captain.\n  \n  • Use .cursorrules to define project rules. • Use git checkpoints. • Use your brain for system thinking and product intuition.\n  \n  p.s. I’m putting together 20+ more hard-earned insights in a doc — including specific prompts, scoped examples, debug flows, and mini PRD templates.\n  \n  If that sounds valuable, let me know and I’ll drop it.\n  \n  Stay caffeinated.
