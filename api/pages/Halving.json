DOI:10.1016/j.intfin.2017.12.004\n- Ongoing research explores:\n  - The long-term effects of halving on miner behaviour and network security.\n  - Price dynamics and market efficiency surrounding halving events.\n  - Comparative analyses of Bitcoin’s deflationary model versus traditional monetary systems.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK, including North England cities such as Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield, hosts a growing blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n  - Several fintech startups and academic institutions in these regions engage in Bitcoin research and development, including halving-related economic modelling.\n- Manchester and Leeds have emerging crypto hubs focusing on blockchain innovation, with some firms providing mining consultancy and market analysis services.\n- UK regulatory bodies maintain a cautious but evolving stance on cryptocurrencies, influencing how halving events are perceived by investors and businesses.\n- Regional case studies highlight local businesses integrating Bitcoin payments and educating communities on halving’s implications for investment and security.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include:\n  - Increasing miner reliance on transaction fees as block rewards diminish, raising questions about long-term network security.\n  - Development of layer-2 scaling solutions and alternative consensus mechanisms to complement Bitcoin’s halving-driven scarcity.\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Maintaining miner incentives amid declining rewards.\n  - Managing market volatility and speculative bubbles around halving events.\n- Research priorities:\n  - Analysing halving’s impact on Bitcoin’s energy consumption and environmental footprint.\n  - Exploring socio-economic effects of Bitcoin’s deflationary model in different jurisdictions, including the UK.\n  - Enhancing predictive models for price and network behaviour around halving cycles.\n\n## References\n\n1.
