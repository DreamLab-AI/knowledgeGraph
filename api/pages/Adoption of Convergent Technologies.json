Take it all with a pinch of salt.\n\t\t\t  Bitcoin looks proper \"drama\" but it's possibly on a very compressed s-curve with a bend to the right sometime after 2030. Again, serious people are saying this, it's not just me, but that line especially is 'brittle'.\n\t\t\t  So, while this isn't exactly academic rigour, it IS inline with the citations across this page. It's a useful glance piece. These are just about the fastest tech adoptions in human history, in one place.\n\t\t\t- ![output.png](../assets/output_1728117882810_0.png){:width 900}\n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- ## Key Findings from earlier in the adoption\n\t\t\t\t- As of August 2024, 39.4% of Americans aged 18-64 reported using generative AI.\n\t\t\t\t- 28% of employed respondents said they use generative AI at work.\n\t\t\t\t- Nearly 1 in 9 workers (10.6%) reported using generative AI daily at work.\n\t\t\t\t- Adoption has been faster than previous transformative technologies like personal computers and the internet.\n\t\t\t\t- ### Adoption Across Industries\n\t\t\t\t\t- Generative AI usage spans a wide range of occupations:\n\t\t\t\t\t- Over 40% adoption in management, business, and computing professions.\n\t\t\t\t\t- 20% of \"blue-collar\" workers (e.g. construction, maintenance, transportation) use generative AI frequently at work.\n\t\t\t\t- ### Common Use Cases\n\t\t\t\t\t- Workers employ generative AI for various tasks:\n\t\t\t\t\t- 57% use it for writing assistance\n\t\t\t\t\t- 49% use it for information searches\n\t\t\t\t\t- Other applications include summarizing reports and generating creative ideas\n\t\t\t\t- ### Potential Impact\n\t\t\t\t\t- Researchers estimate generative AI currently supports 0.5-3.5% of all work hours in the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t- This could potentially boost labor productivity by 0.125-0.875 percentage points, though this estimate is speculative.\n\t\t\t\t- ### Factors Driving Rapid Adoption\n\t\t\t\t\t- The study suggests several reasons for generative AI's quick uptake:\n\t\t\t\t\t- Low cost and portability of tools like ChatGPT and Google Gemini\n\t\t\t\t\t- Widespread access to computers and internet as a foundation\n\t\t\t\t\t- Broad applicability across many occupations and tasks\n\t\t\t\t- While adoption has been swift, researchers caution that the long-term economic impact will depend on how deeply generative AI becomes integrated into daily work processes over time.\n\t\t\t\t-\n- # Ramp Spring 2025 Business Spending Report\n\t- [Ramp’s Spring 2025 Business Spending Report](https://ramp.com/blog/q1-2025-spending-insights)\n\t- **Increase in AI Adoption:**\n\t\t- 35.5% of U.S. businesses now utilize AI, a figure 4.4 times higher than previously reported by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\t\t- The technology, finance, and manufacturing sectors are leading in AI implementation.\n\t- **AI Vendor Adoption:**\n\t\t- OpenAI is the definitive leader in business adoption, with Anthropic following.\n\t\t- Google's AI models have seen a rapid rise in usage, with 69% of respondents to a Kong Inc. survey reporting use of Google's models in the last 90 days, compared to 55% for OpenAI.\n\t- **AI as a Key Productivity Tool:**\n\t\t- 61% of business leaders confirmed their organizations accelerated AI usage in 2024, with more than half planning to increase their AI budgets in 2025.\n\t\t- 72% of enterprises plan to increase their spending on generative AI in the next year, with nearly 40% of those indicating an investment exceeding $250,000 in the current calendar year.\n\t- ## Critical Analysis\n\t\t- **Anecdotal Evidence and Generalisation:**\n\t\t\t- The report is based on Ramp's customer data, which may not represent the broader market. Growth figures could be skewed by a few large companies or early adopters, making the data less generalisable.\n\t\t\t- The focus on rapidly growing vendors like Anthropic might overshadow the fact that many AI tools are still in experimental or early adoption stages.\n\t\t- **Superficial Engagement vs. Deep Integration:**\n\t\t\t- Increased spending may reflect experimentation rather than deep, sustainable integration of AI tools. Companies often try new tools without committing long-term.\n\t\t\t- Retention rates might indicate vendor lock-in rather than genuine satisfaction, as switching costs can deter companies from exploring better options.\n\t\t- **Economic and Market Dynamics:**\n\t\t\t- Spending increases may be driven by economic pressures to boost productivity without increasing headcount, rather than a belief in AI's transformative potential.\n\t\t\t- The surge in AI spending could be driven by hype, with companies adopting AI tools to keep up with competitors, regardless of their actual value.\n\t\t- **Sustainability of Growth:**\n\t\t\t- Rapid growth rates may not be sustainable. As the market matures, AI spending could slow as companies standardise on a few tools or find that efficiency gains do not meet expectations.\n- ## The Gap\n  id:: 659fe0be-a52a-42ef-8f50-73695a802945\n\t- McKinsey identified in 2022 that companies with a 5 year AI roadmap would likely pull ahead. [They called this \"The Gap\"](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-in-2022-and-a-half-decade-in-review#gap)\n\t- Hindsight shows us that this was correct. Those companies feel somewhat unassailable, but the nature of the research publishing environment, and pace of progress, means there are plenty of opportunities.\n\t- ### Ways to close The Gap\n\t\t- [Daily Papers Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/papers)  << you can do worse than this to ambiently learn\n- ## Custom Gen AI models in business\n  id:: 659a9231-4d21-415e-8b07-25b215e6b712\n\t- ![image.png](../assets/image_1704997279791_0.png){:width 500}\n\t- ### **DO play with tools**\n\t  id:: 66f3fee3-6b3f-48df-b61b-2ba06e75b1b4\n\t\t- Use the tools that come free with where you already keep your data (think Google at this time, but also Perplexity)\n\t\t- Start to sort out your data. Learn it's structure, and whether it's useful to optimise it.\n\t\t- High quality data gives high quality outcomes.\n\t\t- See if there's something on the market that is trustable when your data and product are ready, don't spread data about too much.\n\t\t- Do check if this is worth it. Get an expert opinion. Bloomberg spent around $20M on a model based on their financial data only to find that GPT4 [still beats it](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.05862.pdf).\n\t\t- Think about integrating the open tooling into your product development, consider the software licenses. Take **some** legal advice.\n\t\t- Use the paid and private version of [RunDiffusion](https://app.rundiffusion.com/) to start to play with the open tooling.

Encourage employees to share how they are using AI to assist their work.\n\t\t\t- Completely rethink and redesign work processes around AI capabilities, rather than just using AI to automate existing processes. Cut down the org chart and regrow it for AI.\n\t\t\t- Let teams develop their own methods for incorporating AI as an \"intelligence\" that adds to processes. Manage AI more like additional team members than external IT solutions.\n\t\t\t- Align incentives and provide clear guidelines so employees feel empowered to ethically experiment with AI.\n\t\t\t- Build for the rapidly evolving future of AI, not just today's models. Organizational change takes time, so consider future AI capabilities.\n\t\t\t- Act quickly\n\t\t\t- organizations that wait too long to experiment and adapt processes for AI efficiency gains will fall behind. Provide guidelines for short-term experimentation vs slow top-down solutions.\n\t\t\t- Realize there are only two ways to react to exponential AI change; too early or too late. The capabilities are increasing rapidly, so it's better to start adapting sooner than later.\n- # Bitcoin and stable coins\n\t- Bitcoin has developed quickly, with a faster adoption than even the internet, though this is a very strained comparison since Bitcoin is built on the internet and could not exist without it.\n\t- ![2c5673b4.png](../assets/2c5673b4_1760347062021_0.png){:height 465, :width 686}\n\t\t-\n\t\t- As of early 2025, over 500 million people worldwide hold some form of cryptocurrency.\n\t\t- ![image.png](../assets/image_1733138756991_0.png)\n\t\t-\n\t\t- https://crypto.com/company-news/global-cryptocurrency-owners-grow-to-580-million-through-2023\n\t\t- ![GMjjXj5bQAAzvPQ.jpeg](../assets/GMjjXj5bQAAzvPQ_1715376509027_0.jpeg){:width 500, :height 299}\n\t- ## Top Countries for Bitcoin Adoption\n\t\t- According to the Chainalysis \"2024 Crypto Adoption Index\" report, India, Nigeria, and Vietnam are leading the charge in per capita adoption.
