From this base layer we also get the potential for secure and trust minimised identity management. This nascent field of distributed identity management is explained later. From distributed trust models we can see 'trustless' transmission of economic value. The ability to send value from one person to another person or service without a third party.\n  The rest of this book will focus on the trust and value transfer elements of this shift in internet technologies, and attempt to build a case for it's use in decentralised, open source, collaborative mixed reality applications.\n  [\\\\chapterimage]\n\t  It can be seen that the description is somewhat in the eye of the beholder.\n\t- It’s possible to frame this Ethereum Web3 as a hugely complex and ineffi­cient digital rights management system (DRM). DRM is something that users of the internet are increasingly familiar and comfortable with. It’s somewhat debatable whether decentralising this is worthwhile. The thesis of the devel­opers of the technology seems to be that without it, control of ‘value’ will accrete over time, to one or more hegemonic controlling entities. It’s a strong argument, but there is a substantial counter argument emerging that users just don’t want this stuff. The nervousness of legislators in the USA to the attempt by Facebook/Meta to enter this peer-to-peer value transmission space is telling in terms of the perception of who is driving Web3.\n\t\t- The Money Revolution\n\t- Broaden access to the economic benefits of the innovation economy\n\t- Embrace the role of well-regulated stablecoins in financial inclusion and innovation\n\t- Collaborate with other nations to harmonize standards and regulatory frameworks\n- Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer of ‘Circle’ venture capital, said in testimony to a US senate hearing; that Web 1 was ‘read’, Web 2 was ‘read write’, and that Web 3 will ‘read write own’. The important takeaway here is not so much this oft quoted elevator pitch for Web3, but the fact that legislative bodies now consider this technology a force which they need to be aware of and potentially contend with.\n\t- Attention developed around three core themes, ubiquitous availabilityand searchability of data, intelligent search assistants, and highlyavailable end points such as phones, and ‘internet of things’ devices.This is certainly manifesting in home devices, but few people think ofthis as a Web3 revolution.\n-\n\n- #### CivKit\n- CivKit, short for Civilization Kit, is an upcoming white paper from[Commerceblock](https://www.commerceblock.com/), discussing adecentralized and unstoppable free market solution based on Bitcoin.

If peer-to-peer Bitcoin secured yield andloans etc were allowed then it seems unlikely that the less secure andmore convoluted DeFi products would have found a footing. DeFi has beencommonplace over the last couple years, growing from [essentially zeroto $100B](https://a16zcrypto.com/state-of-crypto-report-a16z-2022/) overthe last two or three. It enables trading of value, loans, and interest(yield) without onerous KYC. If Bitcoin’s ethos is to develop at a slowand well checked rate, and Ethereum’s ethos is to move fast and breakthings, then DeFi could best be described as throwing mud and hopingsome sticks. A counter to this comes from Ross Stevens, head of NYDig[who says](https://nydig.com/on-impossible-things-before-breakfast)it“The concept of decentralized finance is powerful, noble, and worthyof a lifetime of focused effort.”. This may be true in principle, butcertainly isn’t the case as things stand.\n\t\t- - ..a “decentralisation illusion” in DeFi due to the inescapable need for centralised governance and the tendency of blockchain consensus mechanisms to concentrate power. DeFi‘s inherent governance structures are the natural entry points for public policy.\n\t\t- - DeFi’s vulnerabilities are severe because of high leverage, liquidity mismatches, built-in interconnectedness and the lack of shock-absorbing capacity.\n\t\t- These are two excellent and likely true points. European Parliament VicePresident [Eva Kaili made this samepoint](https://cointelegraph.com/news/wef-2022-most-defi-protocols-aren-t-really-decentralized-says-european-parliament-vp?)at the World Economic Forum, so clearly regulators are aware of the lackof meaningful distribution in DeFi. In addition access to DeFi is‘usually’ through web.0 centralised portals (websites) which are just asvulnerable to legal takedown orders as any other centralised technology.Given who the major investment players seem to be in this ‘new’financial landscape it seems very likely that regulatory capture iscoming. The seemingly unironic trend towards CeDeFi ([centraliseddecentralisedfinance](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cedefi-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters))illustrates this.\n\t\t- Many more custodial options exist for loans (CASA, Nexo, Ledn, Abraetc). These might not really fit the definition of DeFi at all. Many ofthese centralised DeFi companies (CeDeFi) have imploded in the wake ofthe Terra/Luna collapse since they were generating yield from oneanother and ultimately Terra. The maxim seems to be that if you don’tknow how the system is monetised then you are likely the product. Asmentioned, DeFi itself weathered the recent market turmoil comparativelywell and it’s possible that as these products evolve they may be usefulto companies who have Bitcoin and stablecoins on their balance sheetlong term. Dan Held maintains an [onlinespreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZoapTCl76wahFMeNISSx9UdC3QBx-zC_jY4Le1H5Sdg/htmlview#)which compares these products.\n\t\t- **Functionality**: DeFi aims to automate and make traditional finance more accessible through decentralized applications (dApps).\n\t\t- **Capabilities**: These tools enable activities like loans and interest earning on savings, without middlemen and while maintaining user privacy.\n\t\t- **Criminal Use of DeFi**: The report acknowledges that ransomware attackers, thieves, scammers, and others are exploiting DeFi services for transferring and laundering illicit proceeds.\n\t\t- **Compliance Issues**: Many DeFi applications fail to adhere to U.S. anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations.\n\t\t- **Fiat Currency Usage**: Despite the rise of crypto in illegal transactions, the report notes that money laundering, proliferation financing, and terrorist financing predominantly occur with fiat currency or traditional assets, not virtual ones.\n\n- #### CivKit\n- CivKit, short for Civilization Kit, is an upcoming white paper from[Commerceblock](https://www.commerceblock.com/), discussing adecentralized and unstoppable free market solution based on Bitcoin.
