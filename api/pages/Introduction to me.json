It happens to intersect with my research interests and expertise in the main, and I have highlighted the relevant elements (for me), in pink. Everything there is somewhere, or everywhere in the knowledge base.\n\t- ![1759419477553.jpg](../assets/1759419477553_1759507979104_0.jpg){:height 1141, :width 1187}\n\t-\n- # What are these pages?\n\t- This interface is an example of [[Knowledge Graphing]].\n\t  id:: 661d5f74-5dfe-4569-9374-37b63637b3d8\n\t\t- [[Logseq]] is a knowledge management and note-taking tool, integrated with AI capabilities.\n\t\t- This is updated a couple of times a week, but you WILL need to hit CTRL-R as I didn't code a refresh into it.\n\t\t- Below is the [graph](https://www.visionflow.info/680a51ea177aecc8cafb7003e146622b7ca13257/index.html#/graph) view of about 1/6 of my current research base.\n\t\t- **You can find it as \"Graph\" top right of this page.**\n\t\t- You should probably stop reading this page and go click graph and find something you like.\n\t\t- ![Screenshot 2024-01-30 093017.png](../assets/Screenshot_2024-01-30_093017_1706607172633_0.png)\n- # My research in broad stokes:\n\t- ## Equity of opportunity of access to AI:\n\t\t- Genius is evenly distributed across humanity. There are as many incredible minds per capita in India, South America, Nigeria, China, South East Asia, as anywhere in the highly developed world. Access to the identity rails, money rails, education, technology, and now AI, is *not* equitably distributed. I am trying to change that a little by focusing on protocols.\n\t- ## Convergence :\n\t\t- Everything is smoothing out as GenAI scaffolds human work. The interfaces won't need to be learnt any more. [[Social contract and jobs]] may soon be radically different. This is a [[Convergence]] but is also a [[Disruption]].\n\t- ## Disruption:\n\t\t- This is happening so fast that many are viewing it as a [[Singularity]] event; that we will likely see as many problems as benefits initially. -\n\t- ## The potential opportunity offered by [[Bitcoin]]:\n\t\t- I have been studying Bitcoin technologies for the past 7 years. This novel ecosystem is a non-trivial disruptive force, and is now deeply threaded through my technical research.\n\t- ## My research as a diagram\n\t\t- ((66314b8e-513e-45a6-80e7-493933e46e9e))\n\t\t  id:: 66314bd7-86ef-4ca2-8f39-704e133ac0a3\n\t\t\t- ![graphviz.png](../assets/graphviz_1714508145842_0.png){:height 447, :width 484}\n\t\t-\n- ## Visionflow AR Agentic Knowledge Graph\n\t- Click the cog to remove the settings panel.
