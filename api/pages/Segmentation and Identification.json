SAM-PT uses sparse point selection and propagation techniques to generate masks, achieving strong zero-shot performance on popular video object segmentation benchmarks. Unlike traditional object-centric mask propagation strategies, SAM-PT utilizes point propagation to capture local structure information that is independent of object semantics. The paper also demonstrates the effectiveness of point-based tracking through evaluation on the Unidentified Video Objects (UVO) benchmark. To improve tracking accuracy, SAM-PT employs K-Medoids clustering for point initialization and tracks both positive and negative points to distinguish the target object. Additionally, multiple mask decoding passes and a point re-initialization strategy are used for mask refinement. The paper includes interactive video segmentation demos and showcases the results of SAM-PT on the DAVIS 2017 dataset, highlighting successful cases as well as failure cases. The effectiveness of SAM-PT is further demonstrated on avatar segmentation. The code and models for SAM-PT are available on GitHub. The paper concludes with a citation for reference.](http://www.vis.xyz/pub/sam-pt)\n- Segment and identify\n- [CodingMantras/yolov8-streamlit-detection-tracking: YOLOv8 object detection algorithm and Streamlit framework for Real-Time Object Detection and tracking in video streams.

The model is trained to unify various segmentation tasks into a generalist in-context learning framework, and is evaluated on a broad range of tasks, including few-shot semantic segmentation, video object segmentation, semantic segmentation, and panoptic segmentation. Results show strong capabilities in segmenting in-domain and out-of-domain targets, either qualitatively or quantitatively.](https://buff.ly/3KD0Zns)\n- Video-LLaMA is a project aimed at enhancing large language models (LLMs) with audio and visual understanding capabilities. It is built on top of BLIP-2 and MiniGPT-4 and consists of two core components: Vision-Language (VL) Branch and Audio-Language (AL) Branch. The VL Branch uses a two-layer video Q-Former and a frame embedding layer to compute video representations and is trained on the Webvid-2M video caption dataset with a video-to-text generation task, in addition to image-text pairs from LLaVA. The AL Branch, on the other hand, uses a two-layer audio Q-Former and an audio segment embedding layer to compute audio representations and is trained on video/image instrucaption data to connect the output of ImageBind to language decoder. The project provides pre-trained and fine-tuned checkpoints and users need to obtain them before using the repository. The repository also includes an example output and instructions on how to run the demo locally and how to perform the training.
