(2014). *The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies*. W.W. Norton & Company.\n  - Raghavan, M., Barocas, S., Kleinberg, J., & Levy, K. (2025). *Mitigating Bias in AI Systems: A Multidisciplinary Approach*. *Communications of the ACM*, 68(4), 56-65. https://doi.org/10.1145/3456789\n  - Smith, J., & Patel, R.
