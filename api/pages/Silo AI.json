Fine-tuning foundation models for domain-specific applications is becoming a common practice to enhance model performance with smaller datasets.\n\t- ### AI Talent and Competence Development\n\t- **Shift Towards Competence Development**: There's a noticeable shift from primarily recruiting new AI talent to investing in training and competence development of existing staff, reflecting a strategic approach to building AI capabilities internally.\n\t- **Interdisciplinary Teams**: Successful AI adoption is highlighted by the integration of domain-specific knowledge with technical AI expertise, underscoring the value of interdisciplinary teams.\n\t- ### AI Strategy and Oversight\n\t- **Regulatory Compliance and Ethical AI**: With upcoming regulations like the EU AI Act, companies are prioritizing investments in compliance and ethical considerations, including data privacy and bias mitigation.\n\t- **Strategic AI Adoption**: Leadership with a comprehensive understanding of AI's potential and strategic investment in AI technologies and talent development are key to driving innovation and competitive advantage.\n\t- ### Trends and Observations Over Time\n\t- **Evolving AI Technologies**: The adoption and application of AI technologies have diversified significantly, with a notable increase in the use of machine learning, generative AI, and large language models.\n\t- **Application Areas**: While AI integration into products and services remains prevalent, its use in production and manufacturing processes is gaining momentum, indicating a broader application of AI across different operational domains.\n\t- ### Challenges and Opportunities\n\t- **Navigating AI Hype**: Organizations are tasked with distinguishing between hype and practical AI applications that offer real value, with an emphasis on foundational data management and strategic AI deployment.\n\t- **AI Talent Acquisition and Development**: The demand for AI talent with both technical and domain-specific expertise continues to grow, highlighting the importance of strategic talent management and development initiatives.\n-\n- # Poro 34B\n\t- SiloGen is today announcing a release of the first model checkpoints of a family of multilingual open source large language models (LLMs), covering all official European languages and code.\n\t- Together with the University of Turku and HPLT, SiloGen launched at the end of August an initiative to build [open multilingual LLMs](https://www.silo.ai/blog/silo-ai-launches-a-consortium-to-build-the-worlds-largest-open-llm), with the aim of ensuring European digital sovereignty and democratizing access to LLMs.\n\t- The unique open source initiative combines a world-class team, access to a record amount of compute on Europe’s most powerful supercomputer LUMI, a record amount of data, and a distinctive software layer to train LLMs.\n\t- Two months after initiating the training efforts for a family of models, we are excited to release the first checkpoint milestones for Poro 34B.\n\t-\n\t- Named ‘Poro’ after the Finnish word for reindeer, this new 34 billion parameter LLM for English, Finnish and code is an early look at what is in store from our multilingual model family. Future Poro releases will expand support to other European languages and add capabilities, such as updated model architecture, expanded context window, modalities etc. As one of the first projects in the field of LLMs, we will also be providing external researchers unprecedented access to the training of models. In a program called Poro Research Checkpoints, we will release a series of checkpoints for the model during the training process. Sharing these checkpoints will enable visibility into language model training among researchers and practitioners who do not have the resources to train their own large models from scratch.\n\t- Poro’s advanced capabilities with European languages like Finnish descend from how it addresses the core challenge for low-resource languages: training LLMs requires enormous amounts of data, but for low-resource languages like Finnish, sufficient data is simply not available. In general, Poro addresses this by cross-training low-resource languages with high-resource languages. This takes advantage of a cross-lingual signal that allows the model to achieve higher performance for the low-resource language than training a monolingual model, and has the further advantage of teaching the model basic translation capability.\n\t- After 30% of training, Poro already extends state-of-the-art base model performance on the Finnish language benchmark FIN-bench (e.g. FinGPT[[1]](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1qjVhDXaq61weeqo_3YEnzjJhXch03c4nhsmOhO3x3tw/mobilebasic?), Llama, Mistral), and in light of current experiments expect similar results as we expand to other languages. This is achieved without compromising performance in English, for which Poro is on course to achieve performance on par with, and beyond, comparable open English-oriented models (e.g., Llama and Mistral).\n\t- Poro is the result of a collaboration between Silo AI’s generative AI arm SiloGen and the University of Turku’s TurkuNLP Group and HPLT project, bringing together cutting-edge research and industry expertise.\n\t- ## Features of Poro 34B\n\t\t- Below is a summary of key features of Poro 34B. When training completes we will additionally release instruction and chat tuned varieties of the Poro 34B base model. For transparency with respect to model architecture, data and other technical information, please refer to the official [model card](https://huggingface.co/LumiOpen/Poro-34B).\n\t\t- **Poro Research Checkpoints**: Checkpoints for the model are released throughout the training process, providing external researchers with unprecedented access to investigate the model training process.\n\t\t- **Model architecture: **Poro 34B is 34.2 billion parameters and uses a BLOOM architecture with ALiBi embeddings to allow for context window extrapolation. While model architecture for the initial model has been kept simple, future models under progress will support additional capabilities, such as flash attention, rotary embeddings and grouped query attention.\n\t\t- **Multilingual capabilities**: Poro is designed to process English and Finnish, and has proficiency with a variety of programming languages. Additionally, it can perform basic translation between English and Finnish.\n\t\t- **Open source**: Poro is freely available under the Apache 2.0 License, implying applicability for both commercial and research use.\n\t\t- **Dataset:** The model is trained with a dataset of 1 trillion tokens, with English, Finnish and a variety of programming languages represented.\n\t\t- **Training details**: Poro is trained using 512 AMD MI250X GPUs on the LUMI supercomputer in Finland.\n\t-\n- ### Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)\n\t- **Questions**: How does Silo AI plan to expand its LLM capabilities, and what opportunities exist for leveraging my experience in generative AI and LLMs for enhancing multilingual support or adding new functionalities? **I note the accent on programming in the Poro dataset, is that where you see it being initially useful? Are there plans to expand the implicit use cases?**\n\t- **My understanding of Uralic languages is that word order carries some of the meaning within setences. Has Poro displayed any unexpected features as a result of this.**\n\t- [Semantic search as extractive paraphrase span detection | Language Resources and Evaluation (springer.com)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10579-023-09715-7)\n\t- What of multimodal.\n- ### 2.
