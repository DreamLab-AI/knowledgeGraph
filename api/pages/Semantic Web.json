Tim Berners Lee (of WWW fame) first mentioned the semantic web in 1999 Mark Berners-Lee Tim; Fischetti. Weaving the web.\n  title:: Semantic Web\n\t- “I have a dream for the Web [in which computers] become capable of analyzing all the data on the Web – the content, links, and transactions between people and computers. A \"Semantic Web\", which makes this possible, has yet to emerge, but when it does, the day-to-day mechanisms of trade, bureaucracy and our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines. The \"intelligent agents\" people have touted for ages will finally materialize.”\n- Attention developed around three core themes, ubiquitous availability and searchability of data, intelligent search assistants, and highly available end points such as phones, and ‘internet of things’ devices. This is certainly manifesting in home devices, but few people think of this as a Web3 revolution. Since ratification of the standards by the World Wide Web (W3C) consortium it seems that their imperative toward decentralisation has become lost. Instead, it can be seen that Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Apple have a harmful oligopoly on users data (Sean S Costigan. World Without Mind:) ()Threat of Big Tech (Franklin Foer). 2018.)\n- This is at odds with Berners-Lee’s vision, and he has recently spoken out about this discrepancy, and attempted to refocus the media onto Web3.0.\n\t- It is worth taking a look at his software implementation called Solid, which is far more mindful of the sovereignty of user data. \n\t  “Solid is an exciting new project led by Prof. Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, taking place at MIT. The project aims to radically change the way Web applications work today, resulting in true data ownership as well as improved privacy. Solid (derived from \"social linked data\") is a proposed set of conventions and tools for building decentralized social applications based on Linked Data principles. Solid is modular and extensible and it relies as much as possible on existing W3C standards and protocols.”\n- Excitement around this kind of differentiated trust model, hinted at in ubiquitous availability of data (and implemented explicitly in Solid), has led to exploration of different paths by cryptographers, and this will be described later. For instance, one of the main developers of Solid, Carvelho, is now a leading developer and propotent of Nostr, another very interesting option which will be described later. This technology space is prolific, but still comparatively young and small.\n-\n- # Scrappy AI written section\n\t- ### 1.  **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**\n\t- **Overview**: DIDs are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, self-sovereign digital identities. DIDs are fully under the control of the DID subject, independent from any centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate authority.\n\t- **Use Cases**: DIDs are used in personal identity verification, secure communication, and in enabling individuals to directly own and control their digital identities.\n\t- ### 2.  **Solid (Social Linked Data)**\n\t- **Overview**: While WebID is a part of Solid, the broader Solid project itself deserves mention. Solid aims to reshape the web, allowing users to store their data in personal online data stores (PODs) and share them with applications and services they trust.\n\t- **Use Cases**: Solid enables users to maintain control over their data while using web applications for social networking, data storage, and personalized services without vendor lock-in.\n\t- ### 3.  **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**\n\t- **Overview**: VCs are a standard for conveying claims about an identity in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy-respecting, and machine-verifiable.\n\t- **Use Cases**: They are used in scenarios ranging from proving educational qualifications and professional certifications to identity verification online without revealing unnecessary personal information.\n\t- ### 4.  **Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)**\n\t- **Overview**: Although not directly analogous to WebID, blockchain and DLTs provide the infrastructure for many decentralized identity systems. They offer a secure and immutable way to record transactions and manage identities without central control.\n\t- **Use Cases**: Blockchain technology is behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but is also used for securing digital identities, supply chain management, and in creating decentralized applications (dApps).\n\t- ### 5.  **ActivityPub**\n\t- **Overview**: ActivityPub is a decentralized social networking protocol based on the ActivityStreams 2.0 data format. It provides a client-server API for creating, updating, and deleting content, as well as a federated server-to-server API for delivering notifications and content.\n\t- **Use Cases**: ActivityPub powers decentralized social networks like Mastodon, enabling them to interoperate and share data without a central authority.\n\t- ### 6.  **InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)**\n\t- **Overview**: IPFS is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. IPFS uses content-addressing to uniquely identify each file in a global namespace connecting all computing devices.\n\t- **Use Cases**: IPFS is used for decentralized website hosting, secure file sharing, and as a foundational technology for various decentralized applications (dApps).\n\t- ### 7.  **OAuth and OpenID Connect (OIDC)**\n\t- **Overview**: While not decentralized, OAuth and OIDC are standards for authorization and identity verification across the web. They are widely used in web applications to allow users to log in with existing credentials from services like Google, Facebook, and Twitter.\n\t- **Use Cases**: OAuth and OIDC are used for secure authorization and identity verification across countless web services, providing a smoother user experience while managing access permissions.\n- # Intersection of Semantic and Ontological Knowledge with AI\n\t- overview of how semantic web technologies, ontologies, and knowledge graphs are being integrated with modern Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on fine-tuning, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and large-context multi-shot learning.\n- **Knowledge Injection and Enhancement**\n\t- **Knowledge Graphs for LLM Pre-Training:** LLMs can be pre-trained on knowledge graphs or structured datasets incorporating ontologies, improving factual knowledge and reasoning abilities.\n\t\t- **Example:** K-BERT [1] pre-trained on a knowledge graph.\n\t- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** LLMs use knowledge graphs to retrieve relevant information and incorporate it into their responses.\n\t\t- **Examples:** RAG models [2], Realm [3]\n\t- **Ontologies for Fine-Tuning:** Ontologies can structure fine-tuning data and guide LLMs towards learning specific domain concepts and relations.\n- **Semantic Grounding and Reasoning**\n\t- **Formalizing Knowledge:** Ontologies provide a structured foundation for LLMs to represent and reason about concepts and relationships.\n\t\t- **Example:** Ontology-guided question answering and reasoning with LLMs [4]\n\t- **Improving Consistency:** Semantic technologies can help constrain LLM output to be more consistent with domain knowledge and logical rules defined in ontologies.\n\t- **Explainability:** The use of knowledge graphs and ontologies can contribute to more explainable LLM decisions by tracing the reasoning steps.\n- **Task Adaptation & Generalization**\n\t- **Semantic Transfer Learning:** Leveraging knowledge encoded in ontologies across different tasks and domains can improve LLM adaptability.\n\t- **Zero-Shot/Few-Shot Learning:** Knowledge graphs can support LLMs in learning new tasks with limited training examples by providing rich background knowledge.\n\t  \n\t  **Challenges and Open Research Areas**\n- **Scalability:** Integrating large-scale knowledge graphs with LLMs poses computational challenges, requiring efficient query and retrieval methods.\n- **Knowledge Representation Gaps:** Ensuring ontologies and knowledge graphs are comprehensive and accurately reflect real-world knowledge is an ongoing effort.\n- **Implicit vs. Explicit Knowledge Alignment:** Balancing LLMs' ability to learn implicit knowledge patterns from text with the explicit knowledge in ontologies and knowledge graphs.\n- **Evaluation:** Developing robust benchmarks and evaluation metrics to assess the effectiveness of semantic integration in LLMs.\n- **References**\n- **K-BERT: Enabling Language Representation with Knowledge Graph** (Liu et al., 2019) https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07606 https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07606 https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07606](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07606\n- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks** (Lewis et al., 2020). https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401 ([[https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401)])\n- **REALM: Retrieval-Augmented Language Model Pre-Training** (Guu et al. 2020) https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08909](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08909 ([[https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08909](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08909)])\n- **Ontology-Guided Semantic Consistency Regularization for Zero-shot Learning** (Zhang et al. 2023) https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00416](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00416 ([[https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00416](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00416)])\n  \n  **Let me know if you want to dive deeper into a specific area or explore  additional references!**\n  \n  share\n  \n  more_vert\n  \n  ![profile picture](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLzn2xPZNE9iWDHK_VhFDTYlcKAl4vZRZUYGX9W0m3ZMO0a=s64-c)\n- Integrating Semantic Web, Knowledge Graphs, and Large Language Models\n- ##
