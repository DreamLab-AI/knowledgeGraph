Article 22(1) prohibits solely automated decisions with significant effects unless falling within Article 22(2) exceptions: necessary for contract performance between data subject and controller, authorized by EU or member state law providing suitable safeguards for rights and legitimate interests, or based on data subject's explicit consent. Article 22(3) mandates safeguards for permitted automated decisions including right to obtain human intervention (qualified human reviewer with authority to change decision assessing AI outputs and exercising meaningful discretion rather than rubber-stamping), right to express views (data subjects may provide context, explanations, or objections influencing final determination), and right to contest decision (formal challenge procedures with review and potential reversal), while Article 22(4) restricts decisions based solely on special category data (health, genetic, biometric, racial/ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership, sexual orientation) unless substantial public interest exception applies with suitable safeguards. Compliance requirements encompass determining legal effects or significant effects through criteria including financial impact (credit denial, insurance pricing, employment termination), access to services (healthcare, education, social benefits), legal status (visa, residency, criminal justice), and life opportunities (housing, employment, education), ensuring meaningful human involvement through reviewers with competence to assess AI outputs, authority to change decisions, access to all relevant information beyond AI recommendations, and sufficient time for considered evaluation, providing transparency through information about logic involved in automated processing, significance and envisaged consequences for data subject, and factors considered in decision-making, and implementing technical measures including explainable AI enabling human reviewers to understand decision rationale, audit trails documenting automated and human decision components, bias detection and mitigation ensuring fair treatment across groups, and data quality assurance preventing propagation of errors or outdated information. The 2024-2025 enforcement period witnessed multiple actions establishing that nominal human review insufficient if humans consistently defer to AI outputs (French CNIL cases), automated social welfare systems requiring genuine human discretion (Dutch DPA investigations), and automated employment screening necessitating adequate rejection explanations when AI-driven (Austrian DPA challenges), collectively establishing that Article 22 creates de facto requirement for explainable AI in high-stakes contexts as unexplainable decisions cannot satisfy right to explanation, with decision types commonly subject to Article 22 including credit scoring, recruitment and employment decisions, healthcare diagnoses and treatment recommendations, insurance underwriting and claims processing, and profiling for targeted advertising or content curation when producing significant effects.\n    - maturity:: mature\n    - source:: [[GDPR Article 22]], [[French CNIL]], [[Dutch DPA]], [[WP29 Guidelines]]\n    - authority-score:: 0.95\n\n  - **Semantic Classification**\n    - owl:class:: aigo:GDPRArticle22Compliance\n    - owl:physicality:: VirtualEntity\n    - owl:role:: Process\n    - owl:inferred-class:: aigo:VirtualProcess\n    - belongsToDomain:: [[AIEthicsDomain]]\n    - implementedInLayer:: [[ConceptualLayer]]\n\n  - #### Relationships\n    id:: 0429-gdpr-article-22-compliance-relationships\n\n  - #### OWL Axioms\n    id:: 0429-gdpr-article-22-compliance-owl-axioms\n    collapsed:: true\n    - ```clojure\n      (Declaration (Class :GDPRArticle22Compliance))\n(AnnotationAssertion rdfs:label :GDPRArticle22Compliance \"GDPR Article 22 Compliance\"@en)\n(SubClassOf :GDPRArticle22Compliance :RegulatoryCompliance)\n\n;;

Meta, the parent company of these platforms, has introduced measures to minimize the presence of political content, such as the launch of the Threads app, which aims to de-emphasize news and politics ([The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/24/23425082/meta-threads-app-political-news-content-reduction-facebook-instagram)).\n\t- The internet is becoming like a dark forest:\n\t\t- {{twitter https://twitter.com/itsandrewgao/status/1786879644651991549}}\n\t- Bots that persuade bots that persuade bots\n\t\t- https://www.linkedin.com/posts/emollick_two-weird-things-that-are-going-to-happen-activity-7180768944067072000-Gmtq?\n\t\t- [The majority of traffic from Elon Musk's X may have been fake during the Super Bowl, report suggests | Mashable](https://mashable.com/article/x-twitter-elon-musk-bots-fake-traffic)\n\t- [For Gen Z, TikTok Is the New Search Engine - The New York Times (nytimes.com)](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/16/technology/gen-z-tiktok-search-engine.html)\n\t- [TikTok’s search engine repeatedly delivers misinformation to its majority-young user base, report says | CNN Business](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/18/business/tiktok-search-engine-misinformation/)\n\t- [Revealed: how TikTok censors videos that do not please Beijing | TikTok | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/25/revealed-how-tiktok-censors-videos-that-do-not-please-beijing)\n\t- [The U.S. Is Right to Worry About TikTok | Lawfare (lawfaremedia.org)](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/us-right-worry-about-tiktok)\n\t- [The Toilet Theory of the Internet - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/05/google-generative-ai-search-toilet-theory/678411/) [[Death of the Internet]]\n\t- [[Death of the Internet]] [John Robb: \"Networked Tribalism, AI, and Asteroids\" | The Great Simplification #110 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2n_Jk37cLE)\n\n\n\n## Academic Context\n\n- Brief contextual overview\n  - GDPR Article 22 establishes a qualified right for individuals not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling, where such decisions produce legal or similarly significant effects\n  - The provision was designed to safeguard autonomy and fairness in algorithmic decision-making, particularly in sensitive domains such as finance, employment, and healthcare\n  - Academic foundations rest on principles of data protection, procedural fairness, and the right to explanation, with ongoing debate about the adequacy of current safeguards in the face of increasingly complex AI systems\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Many UK organisations, including banks, insurers, and public sector bodies, have implemented processes to ensure compliance with Article 22 and its UK equivalents\n  - Notable platforms include automated loan assessment systems, recruitment screening tools, and healthcare diagnostic algorithms\n  - In North England, organisations such as Manchester City Council, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Newcastle University, and Sheffield City Council have adopted transparent ADM frameworks, often integrating human review panels and clear appeal mechanisms\n  - Some local authorities in the region have piloted “algorithmic transparency dashboards” to inform residents about automated decisions affecting them\n\n- Technical capabilities and limitations\n  - Modern ADM systems can process vast datasets and generate real-time decisions, but challenges remain in ensuring explainability, fairness, and meaningful human oversight\n  - Limitations include the risk of bias in training data, difficulties in providing comprehensible explanations, and the practical challenge of scaling human review for high-volume decisions\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - The UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) provides guidance on compliance, including templates for Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) and best practices for transparency and human intervention\n  - The British Standards Institution (BSI) has published PAS 2060:2025, offering a framework for assessing the fairness and transparency of automated decision-making systems\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers and sources\n  - Wachter, S., Mittelstadt, B., & Floridi, L.
