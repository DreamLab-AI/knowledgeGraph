**[[Individual Fairness]]**\n        - Requires similar individuals receive similar predictions\n        - Formally: If d(x, x') is small, then d(Ŷ(x), Ŷ(x')) should be small\n        - Strengths: Addresses fairness at granular level\n        - Limitations: Depends on task-specific similarity metric\n\n      - **[[Intersectional Fairness]]**\n        - Evaluates fairness across intersections of multiple sensitive attributes (e.g., race and gender)\n        - Strengths: Captures complex, real-world discrimination patterns\n        - Limitations: Requires larger datasets and sophisticated analysis\n\n    - #### Recent Metrics for LLMs and Generative AI (2023-2025)\n\n      -
