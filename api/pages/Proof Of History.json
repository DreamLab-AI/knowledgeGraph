Creates verifiable passage of time between events without requiring nodes to trust each other.\n  \n  Pioneered by Solana. Not a consensus mechanism alone but combined with PoS for full consensus. Enables 65,000+ TPS by ordering transactions chronologically before consensus.\n  \n  ### Examples\n  - Solana\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
