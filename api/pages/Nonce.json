This proliferation aligns with the once-dismissed [Dead Internet Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory), suggesting that the web is increasingly driven by AI, bots, and algorithms rather than real human interaction. This isn’t just theory—evidence of widespread bot activity has been reported on platforms like [Instagram](https://www.adweek.com/social-marketing/study-15-million-russian-instagram-influencers-followers-are-bots/) and [Twitter](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cia-expert-says-80-twitter-222337217.html), where AI-driven manipulation of follower counts and traffic has become endemic.\n\n- ## Rise of Bots Aligns With Dead Internet Theory\n\t- According to [Imperva](https://www.imperva.com/blog/bad-bot-report-2022-edition/), bots made up 47.4% of internet traffic in 2022.
