An **AI Agent System** is an autonomous software entity that exhibits goal-directed behaviour through continuous [[Perception-Action Cycle|perception-action cycles]]. Unlike passive [[AI Model|AI models]] that simply process inputs and produce outputs, AI agents actively interact with their [[Environment]], learn from experiences, and adapt their strategies to achieve specified objectives.

Whilst 2024 centred on reasoning capability breakthroughs (exemplified by OpenAI's o-series models), 2025 became defined by **AI agents** that could plan, execute, and adapt across complex workflows.\n\n    #### OpenAI's Operator and Autonomous Task Execution\n    [[OpenAI]] launched **Operator** (https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/) in early 2025, initially as a [[Research Preview]] and [[Developer Tool]] focused on automating routine [[Digital Task Automation|digital tasks]]. Operator represents a [[Research Agent]] that can interact with live websites on behalf of users—filling out forms, clicking through interfaces, completing transactions—effectively automating [[Browser Workflow|browser workflows]] with human-level precision. This capability extended beyond simple [[API Integration|API interactions]] to genuine [[Interface Manipulation]], marking a qualitative leap in [[Agent Autonomy]]. OpenAI continued pushing boundaries with models like [[GPT-4.5]] and specialised [[Reasoning Model|reasoning models]] ([[o3-mini]]), alongside launching agents like Operator and [[Deep Research]], announcing the ambitious [[A-SWE]] project ([[Automated Software Engineering]]), and releasing developer tools via the **Agents SDK** (https://platform.openai.com/docs/agents)—the production successor to their earlier \"[[Swarm Framework]]\". These developments have implications for [[Bitcoin]] development automation and [[Smart Contract Auditing]].\n\n    #### Anthropic's Computer Use and Model Context Protocol\n    [[Anthropic]] introduced **Computer Use** (https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use) for [[Claude 3.5 Sonnet]] in October 2024, explicitly as a [[Beta Capability]] requiring appropriate software setup to emulate human cursor and keyboard interactions. This transparency about [[Error Profile|error profiles]] and the need for careful mediation reflected Anthropic's characteristic caution around deploying powerful autonomous capabilities. The **Harmony** feature allowed agents to read, analyse, and modify files directly within users' local directories, opening possibilities for automating wider ranges of digital tasks whilst maintaining appropriate [[Safety Guardrail|guardrails]].\n\n    Perhaps more significantly, Anthropic's **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** (https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) emerged as a critical infrastructure contribution—a standardised framework enabling AI agents to interact with tools, external data, and even other agents to accomplish complex tasks with minimal human intervention. MCP represented Anthropic's bet on [[Interoperability]] as the foundation for scalable [[Agentic System|agentic systems]], in contrast to proprietary vertical integration approaches. MCP has been adopted for [[Bitcoin Node]] management, [[Lightning Network]] operations, and [[Blockchain Data Analysis]].\n\n    #### Agentic Interoperability and Multi-Agent Collaboration\n    The 2025 landscape introduced **Agentic Interoperability Protocols**—effectively a lingua franca for multi-agent collaboration. Agents could now communicate across ecosystems: Google's ADK (Agent Development Kit), LangGraph's orchestration layer, Cisco's SLIM framework, and Anthropic's MCP. This cross-platform communication capability enabled heterogeneous agent teams, where specialised agents from different providers could coordinate on complex tasks—analogous to how microservices architectures transformed software engineering a decade earlier.\n\n    Early 2025 data indicated growing momentum in AI agent exploration and adoption across industries, building upon the significant increase in general AI usage reported by organisations in 2024. The competitive dynamics resembled an arms race: OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google all positioning themselves as leaders in autonomous agent technology, with strategic investments in developer tooling, safety frameworks, and enterprise partnerships.\n\n    #### Implications for Agent Architecture\n    These developments validated several architectural principles that had been theoretical in earlier agent research:\n    - **Tool Use as First-Class Capability**: Agents treating external tools (browsers, file systems, APIs) as natural extensions of their action space\n    - **Multi-Step Planning Under Uncertainty**: Agents maintaining long-horizon goals whilst adapting to unexpected environmental feedback\n    - **Human-in-the-Loop by Default**: Commercial deployments emphasising transparency, interruptibility, and human oversight rather than full autonomy\n    - **Standardised Inter-Agent Communication**: Protocols enabling agent collaboration across organisational and technical boundaries\n\n    The trajectory suggested that by mid-2025, AI agents had transitioned from research curiosities and narrow automation tools to foundational infrastructure for digital work—analogous to how databases, web servers, and cloud platforms became assumed components of software systems over previous decades.\n  -\n  -
