(2000) on reputation management in online communities laid the groundwork for modern trust metrics\n\t- Contemporary models build on formal trust theory, including probabilistic and fuzzy logic approaches to capture the nuanced nature of trust\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n\t- Trust score metrics are embedded in data governance platforms (e.g., Talend, FirstEigen), customer experience analytics (e.g., Gainsight, Retently), and healthcare (e.g., PEP Health)\n\t- Financial services and e-commerce platforms use trust scores for transaction risk assessment and access control\n\t- In the UK, organisations such as NHS Digital and Manchester-based healthtech startups are piloting trust metrics for patient data governance\n- Notable organisations and platforms\n\t- Talend: Data trust score for data quality assessment\n\t- PEP Health: AI-powered patient trust score in healthcare\n\t- Gainsight: Customer experience trust metrics\n\t- NHS Digital: Trust metrics for health data sharing\n- UK and North England examples where relevant\n\t- Manchester’s Health Innovation Manchester initiative has explored trust metrics for regional health data sharing\n\t- Leeds-based fintech firms use trust scores for SME lending decisions\n\t- Newcastle University’s Centre for Cybersecurity is researching trust metrics for smart city infrastructure\n- Technical capabilities and limitations\n\t- Modern trust score metrics can aggregate multiple data points (validity, completeness, usage, discoverability) into a single score\n\t- Limitations include subjectivity in weighting factors, potential for gaming the system, and challenges in cross-domain comparability\n- Standards and frameworks\n\t- ISO/IEC 27001 and NIST Cybersecurity Framework provide guidance on trust and risk assessment\n\t- The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has published best practices for trust metrics in digital services\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers and sources\n\t- Resnick, P., Kuwabara, K., Zeckhauser, R., & Friedman, E.
