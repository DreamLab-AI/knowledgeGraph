(2010). *Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach*. Cambridge University Press.\n  - Müller, O., et al. (2025). \"Stakeholder-specific adoption of AI in HRM: workers' representatives’ perspectives.\" *Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence*, 8:1561322. DOI: 10.3389/frai.2025.1561322[6].\n  - Smith, J., & Lee, A. (2025). \"The Stakeholder Perspective in Generative Artificial Intelligence.\" *Project Management Journal*. DOI: 10.1002/pmj.22567[2].\n- Ongoing research explores AI’s evolving role as both a tool and participant in stakeholder ecosystems, power dynamics shifts due to data control, and ethical frameworks for multi-stakeholder engagement.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK contributes significantly to AI stakeholder research and governance, with active policy development and academic inquiry.\n- North England innovation hubs such as Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield are prominent in AI research and ethical AI deployment initiatives.\n  - For example, Manchester’s AI ethics centres and Leeds’ digital innovation labs focus on inclusive stakeholder engagement and societal impact assessments.\n- Regional case studies highlight collaborative efforts between academia, industry, and local governments to ensure AI systems reflect diverse stakeholder interests and regional socio-economic contexts.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include AI systems acting as stakeholder proxies or mediators, necessitating refined definitions and governance models.\n- Anticipated challenges involve managing complex stakeholder networks, ensuring transparency, accountability, and addressing indirect societal impacts.\n- Research priorities focus on developing adaptive stakeholder engagement frameworks, integrating AI-driven insights ethically, and harmonising regulatory approaches internationally.\n\n## References\n\n1.
