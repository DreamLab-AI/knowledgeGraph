To ground ourselves, we can start with two quotes that should inform any estimates about the future. The first is Amara’s Law “We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.” Social change is slower than technological change. We should not expect to see immediate global effects of AI in a major way, no matter how fast its adoption (and it is remarkably fast), yet we certainly will see it sooner than many people think.```\n\t\t\t- - from [Signs and Portent by Ethan Mollick\n\t\t\t\t- [One Useful Thing](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/signs-and-portents)\n\t\t- [[Update Cycle]] reminder to update this page!\n\t\t\t- [Roy Amara Oxford Reference](https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780191826719.001.0001/q-oro-ed4-00018679)\n\t\t\t- [AI Index Report 2024 – Artificial Intelligence Index (stanford.edu)](https://aiindex.stanford.edu/report/)\n\t\t\t- [I.

[[Death of the Internet]] [[Social contract and jobs]]\n\t\t- ### The UK situation.\n\t\t- Every time a phase change of technology has been introduced there has been a fundamental shift in governance structures. These take time to play out. Electronic communication allowed global awareness of corruption, and there is a well documented breakdown of [[Privacy, Trust and Safety]] since. We can perhaps see this in the way that leaders are abandoning the pretence of 'norms' in the West.\n\t\t- More agile (emerging?) economies / countries may be able to take far more advantage, if they are allowed to, but make no mistake, the UK is currently well positioned. - 🟢 The UK is systemically well positioned to deal with sudden change, because the vertical integration of ministries allows them to be spun up and down in response to change regardless of the leadership. An agile AND persistent civil service can be effective in times of stress.\n\t\t\t- [Ian Hogarth to lead UK’s AI Foundation Model Taskforce\n\t\t- he's actually a great choice](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tech-entrepreneur-ian-hogarth-to-lead-uks-ai-foundation-model-taskforce)\n\t\t\t- [Welcome to State of AI Report 2023](https://www.stateof.ai/)\n\t\t\t- America is supportive of UK positioning around [[Privacy, Trust and Safety]].

Intentional UX will allow users to ask their AI to bring them the information they want from a far more decentralised and confusing internet. This will promote incredible diversity in humans as they fracture somewhat into informational enclaves.\n\t\t\t- Two future scenarios include the rise of AI in Truth Verification and Education. AI will become sophisticated enough to verify the truthfulness of information on the internet, combating the spread of misinformation and ensuring that users have access to accurate and reliable informa- tion. AI will also become an integral part of education, acting as a personalised tutor that adapts to each student's learning style and pace, revolutionising the way we learn and acquire new skills.\n\t\t\t- Money will change: Next -Later  : Money will increasingly be spent by machines on behalf of human intent. Algorithms will bargain and arbitrage on behalf of their owner/user, for human and machine services, and for ideas, algorithms, and good; globally. This will smooth out the operation of money globally.\n\t\t\t- Ubiquitous multi-modal UX: Next to Later The future will see the rise of ubiquitous displays, computing [43], and interfaces\n\t\t\t- screens and projections seamlessly integrated into our environments. These displays will not only provide information and entertainment but will serve as interfaces for our interactions with AI. Gesture may come to the fore, and subvocalisation to talk to personal AIs will be possible.\n\t- ### [Industry perspective](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-xhDmZxdJW-industry-predictions-engine/)  << this is 133 industry reports in a GPT I have made.\n\t- <iframe src=\"https://chat.openai.com/share/bbe7c775-b764-40c3-b87e-cf87fdd1a3a7\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 600px\"></iframe>\n- [[rework based on gpt]]\n- This is a [[presentation]] slide and the next slide is\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
