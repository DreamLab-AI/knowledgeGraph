Recent developments emphasise verifiable reward frameworks and soft scoring mechanisms. UK context added reflects genuine regional AI research activity, though specific North England case studies remain limited in publicly available literature—this represents an opportunity for local documentation as the field matures regionally.\n\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-11\n- **Review Status**: Comprehensive editorial review\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
