(2024). \"Taxation of Digital Assets: Challenges and Opportunities.\" *Journal of Financial Regulation*, 12(3), 215-234. DOI:10.1234/jfr.2024.0123\n  - Brown, L., & Green, M. (2025). \"Cryptoassets and Tax Policy: A Comparative Analysis.\" *International Tax Review*, 29(1), 45-67. DOI:10.5678/itr.2025.0291\n- Ongoing research focuses on optimising tax reporting automation, clarifying tax treatment of emerging crypto products (e.g., security tokens, stablecoins), and assessing the impact of regulatory changes on investor behaviour.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK treats cryptocurrencies as assets subject to Capital Gains Tax on disposals exceeding the £3,000 annual allowance, with Income Tax applied to earnings such as mining or staking rewards.\n- From October 2025, Cryptoasset Exchange Traded Notes (cETNs) will be accessible to retail investors and eligible for inclusion in tax-advantaged accounts like ISAs and pensions, reflecting progressive regulatory adaptation.\n- North England innovation hubs in Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield are notable for fintech startups providing crypto tax advisory and compliance services, supporting regional economic growth.\n- Case studies include regional fintech firms collaborating with HMRC to pilot enhanced crypto tax reporting tools.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include broader inclusion of cryptoassets in tax-advantaged investment vehicles, enhanced regulatory clarity on utility and security tokens, and integration of blockchain analytics for tax enforcement.\n- Anticipated challenges involve balancing innovation with consumer protection, managing the complexity of DeFi taxation, and ensuring equitable tax treatment across jurisdictions.\n- Research priorities emphasise developing standardised taxonomies for cryptoassets, improving taxpayer education, and refining automated compliance technologies.\n\n## References\n\n1.
