The virtual world will need to be policed and governed in a way that will not only protect the rights of the citizens of this new digital environment but also protect them from cybercrime. As a somewhat strained but interesting example; [Interpol see](https://www.reuters.com/technology/interpol-says-metaverse-opens-up-new-world-cybercrime-2022-10-27/) simulated environments as a way for terrorist groups to gather and plan attack. Governments and regulatory bodies will play a key role in the governance of the virtual world, but so will the industry and businesses. Nair et al describe the “unprecedented privacy risks” of the metaverse, finding that wearing a headset can currently reveal 25 data points about the user, simply by analysis of the data [[401](https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx401), [402](https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx402)]. This included inference about ethnicity, disability, and economic status. Strong data protection laws will be needed to safeguard privacy, data ownership and reduce the risk of data breaches. The governance of the virtual world will be critical to success, safeguarding will be needed to protect citizens from cyberattacks.\n- ## Safeguarding in the Metaverse\n  \n  When it comes to safeguarding in the Metaverse, people need to be made aware of the risk of using VR technology. There are still many questions around the health implications of using VR and the impact it may have on a person’s eyesight. In terms of safeguarding in the Metaverse, this is just one area that needs to be addressed. Users will also need to be made aware of the risks of hacking. Users will need to be educated on the need to be careful when it comes to sharing personal information and be careful what websites they access on a virtual computer. They will need to be made aware of the potential risk of having malware installed on their computer by visiting untrusted websites. Users will also need to be made aware of the potential risk of being manipulated in the virtual world. This risk is particularly high when it comes to children who are growing up in the digital world. They will need to be educated on the potential risks of being groomed or manipulated in the Metaverse.\n- The problem with large social metaverse systems seems to be somehow wrapped up in humans need to test boundary conditions in novel surroundings:\n\t- Despite ‘best efforts’ by the software vendors there is a chaotic mix of levels of maturity amongst the participants. Ostensibly safe games are themselves ‘gamed’ by [slightly older](https://futurism.com/mom-horrified-her-kids-seeing-roblox) players.\n\t- No recording of action, and reaction, creating a feeling of impunity of action. At it’s best ‘The philosophers Island’, but in safeguarding terms it seems more a school yard without a teacher, or perhaps worse, Lord of the Flies [[403](https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx403)].\n\t- Activision are engaging with this using AI observers [Call of Duty will use AI to moderate voice chats\n\t\t- The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/30/23852652/call-of-duty-activision-modulate-toxmod-artificial-intelligence-voice-moderation)\n\t- Even adults in exclusively adult meeting places seem to go slightly off the rails trying to find technical and social boundaries instinctively. This leads to the now somewhat famous (TTP) “time to penis” problem [[404](https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx404)] ([coined at GDC 2009](http://gamedesignreviews.com/reviews/little-big-planet-browsing-content/)).\n- The research on this is pretty thin.\n\t- People seem to be suffering genuine psychological harm. [Article in immersive wire](https://www.immersivewire.com/p/harassment-metaverse-how-address)\n- ## How to fight against cybercrime in the Metaverse?\n  \n  The best way to fight against cybercrime in the Metaverse is to educate the general public on the potential risks and dangers in order to prevent them from being targeted. This can be done through various channels and mediums, such as social media, blogs and podcasts. People will need to be made aware of the risks of opening emails or clicking on links sent by unknown people. They will also need to be aware of the risks of clicking on ads and links that may lead them to websites that host malware or that steal personal information.
