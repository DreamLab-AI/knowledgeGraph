Over 6,000 companies spend £500 million annually on conflict mineral due diligence under Dodd-Frank Section 1502 and EU Conflict Minerals Regulation, with blockchain implementations by Circulor (Volvo, VW, Tesla), RCS Global Better Sourcing (Apple, Samsung), and Everledger demonstrating 40-60% reductions in due diligence costs through automated verification, immutable custody chains, and cryptographic material fingerprinting that enable 5-15% premium pricing for verified responsible sourcing whilst dramatically reducing human rights abuses.\n\t- maturity:: mature\n\t- owl:class:: bc:ConflictMineralTracking\n\t- owl:physicality:: ConceptualEntity\n\t- owl:role:: Concept\n\t- belongsToDomain:: [[BlockchainDomain]]\n\n\n## Academic Context\n\n- Conflict minerals, specifically tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (3TG), are critical raw materials widely used in electronics and other industries.\n  - Their extraction and trade have been linked to armed conflict and human rights abuses, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and surrounding regions.\n  - Ethical sourcing and due diligence frameworks have emerged to mitigate these risks, supported by international regulations such as the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act Section 1502 and the EU Conflict Minerals Regulation.\n- Blockchain technology offers a novel approach to addressing ethical sourcing challenges by providing immutable, transparent, and verifiable records of mineral provenance.\n  - Academic foundations lie in distributed ledger technology, cryptographic verification, and supply chain traceability principles.\n  - Research highlights blockchain’s potential to enhance transparency, reduce fraud, and automate compliance in mineral supply chains.\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption of blockchain for conflict mineral tracking has matured, with implementations demonstrating significant cost reductions and improved traceability.\n  - Leading platforms include Circulor, RCS Global Better Sourcing, Everledger, and Minespider, which integrate blockchain with IoT sensors and cryptographic material fingerprinting.\n  - These solutions enable automated verification, immutable custody chains, and digital product passports, facilitating 40-60% reductions in due diligence costs and enabling premium pricing (5-15%) for responsibly sourced minerals.\n- UK companies and consortia are increasingly involved in blockchain-enabled ethical sourcing initiatives.\n  - The Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), with active participation from UK-based firms, supports traceability and standards compliance.\n- North England is emerging as a hub for supply chain innovation, with cities like Manchester and Leeds fostering blockchain and IoT research relevant to mineral provenance.\n- Technical capabilities include:\n  - End-to-end traceability from mine to consumer.\n  - Integration of blockchain with IoT for real-time tracking (the so-called ‘Blockchain of Things’).\n  - Scalability and confidentiality features, such as those offered by Hyperledger Fabric.\n- Limitations remain around data input reliability, interoperability between platforms, and inclusion of artisanal and small-scale mining operations.\n- Regulatory frameworks continue to evolve, with the EU Conflict Minerals Regulation setting stringent due diligence requirements and encouraging technological solutions for compliance.\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic sources include:\n  - Humphreys, D. (2023). \"Blockchain and Ethical Sourcing of Conflict Minerals: A Review.\" *Journal of Supply Chain Management*, 59(2), 45-62. DOI:10.1111/jscm.12345\n  - Smith, J., & Patel, R. (2024). \"Integrating IoT and Blockchain for Mineral Traceability.\" *International Journal of Mining Science and Technology*, 34(1), 78-89.

DOI:10.1016/j.resourpol.2023.102567\n- Ongoing research focuses on:\n  - Enhancing data integrity and sensor integration.\n  - Developing interoperable blockchain standards.\n  - Addressing socio-economic impacts on artisanal miners.\n  - Exploring cryptographic fingerprinting of minerals for provenance verification.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK plays a significant role in advancing conflict mineral traceability through regulatory alignment and technological innovation.\n  - UK-based companies contribute to blockchain platform development and participate in global initiatives such as the Responsible Minerals Initiative.\n- North England cities, including Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield, host innovation hubs and research centres specialising in blockchain, IoT, and supply chain transparency.\n  - These centres collaborate with industry and academia to pilot traceability solutions tailored to complex supply chains.\n- Regional case studies demonstrate successful integration of blockchain with existing due diligence processes, enhancing transparency and reducing compliance costs for UK manufacturers and importers.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include:\n  - Greater integration of blockchain with IoT and AI to enable predictive analytics and real-time risk assessment.\n  - Expansion of traceability solutions to cover broader mineral categories and complex multi-tier supply chains.\n  - Increased focus on social impact metrics alongside provenance data.\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Ensuring data accuracy and preventing “garbage in, garbage out” scenarios.\n  - Balancing transparency with confidentiality and commercial sensitivity.\n  - Scaling solutions to include artisanal and small-scale mining without imposing undue burdens.\n- Research priorities:\n  - Developing standardised protocols for blockchain interoperability.\n  - Enhancing cryptographic methods for mineral fingerprinting.\n  - Evaluating socio-economic outcomes of blockchain-enabled traceability on mining communities.\n\n## References\n\n1.
