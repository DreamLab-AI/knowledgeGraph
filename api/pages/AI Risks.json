These challenges span from immediate operational threats to long-term [[Existential Risk|existential concerns]], demanding coordinated responses from [[AI Governance|governments]], [[AI Safety Research|research institutions]], and the [[Technology Industry|private sector]]. As we enter 2025, the landscape of AI risks has become increasingly complex, requiring sophisticated [[Risk Management|risk management frameworks]] and international cooperation.\n- ## Categories of AI Risk: A Taxonomic Framework\n\t- The [[AI Safety]] community and [[AI Governance|regulatory bodies]] have developed several taxonomies for understanding AI risks:\n\t- ### Near-term vs Long-term Risks\n\t\t- **Near-term risks** (0-5 years): [[Algorithmic Bias]], [[Privacy Protection|privacy violations]], [[Deepfakes]], [[AI-powered Cyberattacks]], [[Job Displacement|employment disruption]]\n\t\t- **Medium-term risks** (5-15 years): [[Autonomous Weapons]], [[AI Surveillance]], [[Economic Disruption]], [[Information Warfare]]\n\t\t- **Long-term risks** (15+ years): [[Artificial General Intelligence|AGI]] [[AI Alignment|alignment failures]], [[Existential Risk]], [[Value Lock-in]], [[AI Takeoff Scenarios]]\n\t- ### Risk Severity Classification\n\t\t- **Critical risks**: Potential for catastrophic or existential harm ([[AI Safety Research]])\n\t\t- **High risks**: Significant societal or individual harm ([[EU AI Act]] high-risk classification)\n\t\t- **Medium risks**: Substantial but containable harm\n\t\t- **Low risks**: Minimal or manageable harm\n- ## Malicious Use and Security Threats\n\t- A primary and immediate concern is the weaponization of AI by malicious actors. [[Generative AI]] is increasingly seen as a dual-use technology that can amplify existing threats, increasing the speed, scale, and sophistication of attacks. The [[AI Security Alliance]] and [[MITRE ATLAS]] framework document these evolving threats.\n\t- ### Cyberattacks and Fraud (AI-RISK-002)\n\t\t- [[AI-powered Cyberattacks]] represent a step-change in [[Cybersecurity]] threats:\n\t\t- **Automated vulnerability discovery**: [[Machine Learning]] models can identify zero-day exploits faster than human researchers, as demonstrated by [[Google DeepMind]]'s [[Big Sleep]] project in 2024\n\t\t- **Adaptive malware**: AI-powered [[Malware]] that evolves to evade detection systems, utilizing [[Adversarial Machine Learning]] techniques\n\t\t- **Sophisticated phishing**: [[Large Language Models]] (LLMs) generate highly personalized and convincing [[Social Engineering]] attacks\n\t\t- **AI-generated exploits**: Automated generation of exploit code from vulnerability descriptions\n\t\t- The **2024 State of AI Security Report** by [[Pillar Security]] found that 78% of organizations experienced AI-related security incidents, with 43% involving production [[LLM]] applications across [[AWS]], [[Azure]], and [[Google Cloud Platform]]\n\t\t- **AI-enhanced fraud**: [[Synthetic Identity Fraud]] using AI-generated identities costs the financial sector an estimated $23 billion annually (2024 [[Federal Reserve]] data)\n\t\t- **Bitcoin-AI convergence risk**: [[Autonomous AI Agents]] with [[Bitcoin]] payment capabilities could automate financial fraud, [[Ransomware]] payments, and [[Money Laundering]] at unprecedented scales, challenging [[AML|Anti-Money Laundering]] systems\n\t- ### Disinformation and Impersonation (AI-RISK-003)\n\t\t- The convergence of [[Generative AI]], [[Deepfakes]], and [[Large Language Models]] poses existential threats to [[Information Integrity]]:\n\t\t- **Deepfake proliferation**: [[Synthetic Media]] creation costs dropped 99.8% from 2020-2024, democratizing [[Deepfake]] production\n\t\t- **Real-time voice cloning**: [[ElevenLabs]], [[Resemble AI]], and other platforms enable real-time [[Voice Cloning]] with <30 seconds of audio\n\t\t- **Political interference**: The [[2024 US Presidential Election]] saw over 1,200 documented [[AI-generated Disinformation]] campaigns, according to [[NewsGuard]]\n\t\t- **AI-generated news**: [[Unreliable AI-generated News Sites]] (UAINS) proliferated to over 800 sites by Q4 2024, undermining [[Media Literacy]]\n\t\t- **Identity theft**: [[Synthetic Identity]] creation for [[Social Engineering]] and [[Fraud]]\n\t\t- **Election integrity**: [[AI-powered Disinformation]] campaigns threaten [[Democratic Processes]], prompting

Trust]]\n\t- ### Autonomous Weaponry (AI-RISK-004)\n\t\t- The development of [[Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems]] (LAWS) represents one of the most contentious AI risk areas:\n\t\t- **Current deployment**: As of 2025, 30+ countries have deployed some form of [[Autonomous Weapons]], including the [[Turkey]]'s STM Kargu-2, [[Israel]]'s Harpy, and various [[Loitering Munitions]]\n\t\t- **International governance gap**: The [[UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons]] (CCW) Group of Governmental Experts on LAWS has failed to reach consensus on binding regulations since 2014\n\t\t- **Accountability vacuum**: [[AI Liability]] frameworks struggle with determining responsibility when [[Autonomous Systems]] make lethal decisions\n\t\t- **Proliferation concerns**: [[Arms Control]] experts warn of an [[AI Arms Race]] with minimal barriers to entry\n\t\t- **Escalation risks**: [[Autonomous Weapons]] may lower the threshold for conflict initiation and increase [[Accidental War]] risks\n\t\t- Organizations like the [[Campaign to Stop Killer Robots]], [[Future of Life Institute]], and [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] advocate for preemptive bans\n\t- ### AI-Powered Surveillance and Privacy Violations (AI-RISK-005)\n\t\t- [[AI Surveillance]] systems have created what [[Shoshana Zuboff]] calls \"[[Surveillance Capitalism]] on steroids\":\n\t\t- **Facial recognition proliferation**: Over 100 countries now deploy [[Facial Recognition]] systems, with accuracy rates exceeding 99.7% for cooperative subjects ([[NIST FRVT]]
