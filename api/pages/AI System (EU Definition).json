Global Policy Watch. DOI: Not available; URL: https://www.globalpolicywatch.com/2025/06/european-commission-guidelines-on-the-definition-of-an-ai-system/[1]\n  - Deloitte (2024). *Defining AI under the EU AI Act: Clarity for Compliance and Innovation*. Deloitte Insights. URL: https://www.deloitte.com/lu/en/Industries/technology/perspectives/defining-ai-under-the-eu-ai-act.html[5]\n  - European Parliament (2023). *EU AI Act: First Regulation on Artificial Intelligence*. URL: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence[6]\n- Ongoing research focuses on improving AI transparency, mitigating bias, and enhancing adaptive learning while ensuring compliance with evolving legal standards.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- Although the UK is no longer an EU member, it closely monitors and often aligns with EU AI regulatory developments to maintain trade and innovation synergies.\n- Northern England, including innovation hubs in Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield, is actively developing AI systems that balance autonomy with ethical considerations.\n  - Manchester’s AI research centres collaborate with industry to develop adaptive AI for healthcare diagnostics and urban planning.\n  - Leeds and Sheffield focus on AI applications in manufacturing and logistics, emphasising compliance with emerging standards akin to the EU AI Act.\n  - Newcastle’s AI initiatives include smart city projects utilising AI systems that adapt to real-time environmental data, mindful of privacy and ethical constraints.\n- UK academic institutions contribute to AI governance research, often referencing the EU AI Act as a benchmark for responsible AI development.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include the refinement of general-purpose AI models under stricter regulatory scrutiny and the integration of AI literacy requirements for users.\n- Anticipated challenges involve balancing innovation with risk mitigation, particularly in high-risk sectors such as law enforcement and healthcare.\n- Research priorities focus on explainability, robustness against adversarial attacks, and harmonising international AI regulations to avoid a patchwork of conflicting standards.\n- A subtle reminder: as AI systems become more autonomous, one hopes they don’t develop a sense of humour—lest they start rewriting their own regulations!\n\n## References\n\n1.
