This short [narrative excerpt titled \"Duality\" purportedly by Satoshi Nakamoto](https://bitcoin-zar.blogspot.com/2018/07/duality-excerpt-by-satoshi-nakomoto.html) is a fabulous look at the [[monetary values]] of the technology, irrespective of its provenance. In it is the following text:\n\t\t\t- \"Here, for once, was this idea that you could generate your own form of [[money]]. That's the primary and sole reason, is because it was related to this thing called money. It wasn't about the proficiency of the code or the novelty, it was because it had to do with money. It centred around money. That is something people cared about. After all, plenty of projects on [[Sourceforge]] at the time were just as well coded, well maintained, if not better, by teams, and even if someone else had created the [[blockchain]] before me, had it been used for something else beyond [[currency]], it probably would not have had much of an outcome.\"\n\t\t- Again, irrespective of the author here, this point seems to ring true. The [[memetic power]] of [[Bitcoin]] is in its proximity to [[money]], and the potential of the [[separation of money and state]].\n\t\t- It is beyond argument that the [[Bitcoin network]] is a rugged [[message passing protocol]] which achieves a high degree of [[consensus]] about the entries on its [[distributed database]].\n\t\t- Ascribing [[monetary value]] to those [[database entries]] is a [[social consensus]] problem, and this itself is a contested topic. The most useful 'hot take' here is that [[Bitcoin]] behaves most like [digital property according to Michael Saylor](https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1395788419301773312), while its [[network]] behaves far more like a [[monetary network]] which is created and supported by the [value of the Bitcoin tokens as analyzed in this Keynesian perspective](https://saito.tech/an-response-to-paul-krugman-from-a-keynesian-bitcoiner/).\n\t\t- **[[Jack Mallers]]** of [[Strike]], in his [presentation to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Bitcoin as global monetary infrastructure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb-45m9f76I), identified the following challenges which he claims are solved by the [[Bitcoin monetary network]]:\n\t\t\t- **[[Speed]]**: Traditional [[payment systems]] suffer from slow [[settlement]] times\n\t\t\t- **Limited [[Transparency]] and [[Dependability]]**: Opaque [[financial infrastructure]] and unreliable [[cross-border payments]]\n\t\t\t- **High [[Cost]]**: Excessive [[transaction fees]] and [[intermediary]] costs\n\t\t\t- **Lack of [[Interoperability]]**: Fragmented [[payment networks]] that don't communicate\n\t\t\t- **Limited [[Coverage]]**: Geographic restrictions in [[financial services]] access\n\t\t\t- **Limited [[Accessibility]]**: [[Banking]] barriers for [[unbanked]] populations\n\t\t- He further identifies the attributes of the ideal [[global money]]:\n\t\t\t- **[[Uncensorable]]**: Resistant to [[financial censorship]] and [[transaction blocking]]\n\t\t\t- **[[Unfreezable]]**: Assets cannot be [[frozen]] by third parties\n\t\t\t- **[[Permissionless]]**: Open [[access]] without [[gatekeepers]] or approval requirements\n\t\t\t- **[[Borderless]]**: Functions globally without [[geographic restrictions]] or [[capital controls]]\n\t\t\t- **[[Liquid]]**: Easy convertibility and deep [[market liquidity]]\n\t\t\t- **[[Digital]]**: Native to the [[internet]] for seamless [[digital commerce]]\n\t\t- **[[Strike]] [[Payment Infrastructure]] (Updated 2025)**: [[Mallers]] has announced USA-focused partnerships leveraging his [[Strike]] product to enable spending [[Bitcoin]], through [[Lightning Network]], as [[Dollars]] in much of the [point-of-sale (POS) systems from NCR and other providers](https://www.ncr.com/point-of-sale-pos-systems) infrastructure in the USA. This is a huge advance as it immediately enables [[vendors]] both online and at physical locations to either save 3% costs for [[card processors]], or else pass this on as a discount. Crucially for '[[Bitcoin as Money]]' it also allows the [[merchants]] to receive the [[payment]] **as [[Bitcoin]]**, not [[Dollars]]. A possible further and highly significant feature is that it might now be possible to divest of [[Bitcoin]] in the USA, buying goods, without a [[capital gains tax]] implication. [[Mallers]] claims to have [[legislative]] backing for this product, but the devil will likely be in the detail. The likely mechanism for this product is that the [[EPOS]] partner sends a [[Lightning]] request to [[Strike]], which liquidates some of their [[Bitcoin]] holding to a [[dollar-denominated]] [[stablecoin]], but in a tax-free jurisdiction such as [[El Salvador]]. This [[stablecoin]] will then be sent to the [[EPOS]] handling partner such as [[NCR]]. [[Stablecoin]] to [[Dollar]] transactions in the USA are much murkier and likely don't cost anything for these companies. This agent will then authorize the [[Dollar]]-denominated sale to the American [[digital till]]. Crucially nobody has a US [[capital gains tax]] exposure in this chain, and all of the [[settlements]] were near free, and instantaneous, with [[cash finality]] for everyone except the [[EPOS]] company. They are likely actually exposed to a small risk here because uptake will be very low level. The novelty opportunity will likely cover any potential exposure to [[stablecoin collapse]]. This is a radical upgrade on the normal flow of divesting [[Bitcoin]] for American users.\n\t\t- **[[Merchant Adoption]] (2025 Update)**: Using this open product to spend [[Bitcoin]] as [[Bitcoin]] to [[vendors]] is now available through [[Shopify]] globally and expanding rapidly. A [2025 Deloitte study on merchants preparing for cryptocurrency adoption](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/technology/us-cons-merchant-getting-ready-for-crypto.pdf) found that 93% of businesses accepting [[Bitcoin]] have seen [[revenue]] and [[brand perception]] improve, and 75% of USA sales executives plan to accept [[digital assets]] at some point in the next 2 years. This ambition in the US markets is likely to benefit from the proposed $200 tax exempt law for purchasing goods and services with [[Bitcoin]]. As of 2025, [[Lightning Network]] payment volumes have exceeded $2 billion annually, with over 15,000 [[nodes]] routing [[transactions]] globally and [[channel capacity]] surpassing 5,000 BTC.{{[[cite]]}} [Lightning Network Statistics 2025, Bitcoin Visuals]\n\t\t- **[[Lyn Alden]]** on [[Lightning Network]] developments: In her [analysis of Strike and Lightning adoption](https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1512188883101966351), [[Alden]] observes: \"Some people naturally dismiss [[Strike]] because they don't want to spend their BTC; they want to save it. However, the more places that accepted BTC at [[point of sale]] ([[on-chain]] or [[Lightning]] or otherwise), the more [[permissionless]] the whole [[network]] is. This is because, if all you can do with BTC is convert it back into [[fiat]] on a major [[exchange]], then it's easy to isolate it, effectively [[blacklist]] addresses, etc. But if you can directly spend it on goods and services across companies and jurisdictions, it's harder to isolate. There are now plenty of [[vendors]] that make this easy for [[merchants]] to implement, and the merchant can still receive [[dollars]] if they want (rather than BTC), or can decide their % split. Since it's an [[open network]], anyone can build on it, globally. And then when you add [[fiat-to-BTC-to-fiat]] payments over [[Lightning]], it gets even more interesting because it doesn't necessarily need to be a [[taxable event]]. [[Lightning wallets]] with a BTC balance and a [[USD]]/[[stablecoin]] balance. Lower fees than [[Visa]] and others.\"\n\t\t- ##### [[African Bitcoin Adoption]] (2025)\n\t\t\t- [[Africa]] has one of the most fragmented [[banking]], [[payment]], and [[currency systems]] in the world, which makes simple [[financial tasks]] like paying a bill, sending money, or accepting money extremely difficult. Over half of Africa does not have access to a [[bank account]], so people hold and save everything in [[cash]], which is often stolen and loses value due to [[inflation]]. It is also difficult to get money in and out of many African countries because only about 40% of people have active [[internet access]], and must rely on [[financial institutions]]. [[Bitcoin]] is being used in [[Africa]] as an alternative form of [[money]] that resolves these issues. It is being taught in [[education centers]] in underdeveloped areas, giving children the opportunity to learn about and use [[Bitcoin]] as a way to access [[financial services]] that have been unavailable to them for generations. However, the rest of the country may have difficulty implementing the use of [[Bitcoin]] due to issues such as a lack of [[electricity]] and [[internet access]], as well as [[government policies]] that centralize power. As of 2025, [[peer-to-peer]] [[Bitcoin trading]] volumes in Africa have grown 400% since 2021, with [[Nigeria]], [[Kenya]], and [[South Africa]] leading [[adoption]].{{[[cite]]}} [Chainalysis Geography of Cryptocurrency 2025]\n\t- ##### [[Bitcoin-backed Fiat]] and [[Dollar-denominated Payments]]\n\t\t- More interestingly for [[metaverse]] applications, [[Mallers]] has opened this section of the company to interact with the public [[Lightning Network]], allowing people with a [[self-hosted wallet]] or [[node]] to pay directly for goods across America, settling immediately in [[Dollars]], using their [[Bitcoin]], at zero cost. **This opens the possibility to buy from US-based ([[Dollar]]-denominated) [[metaverse]] stores, using the capabilities of the stack assembled at the end of the book**. The implications globally are unclear at this time.\n\t\t- **[[Stablesats]]**: [Stablesats](https://stablesats.com/) is another approach which uses exclusively [[Lightning]] [[Bitcoin]] but makes the value stable against the [[US dollar]] using an [[algorithm]]. This [[synthetic stablecoin]] mechanism provides [[dollar stability]] while maintaining [[Bitcoin]] settlement rails. This is a very interesting option providing [[USD-denominated]] accounts on the [[Lightning Network]] without requiring traditional [[stablecoins]].\n\t- #### [[Saving]] with [[Bitcoin]]\n\t\t- The [[Bitcoin community]] believes that [Bitcoin is the ultimate money (Svetski analysis)](https://svetski.medium.com/why-bitcoin-not-shitcoin-6cc826f4fa52), a [store of value according to JPMorgan analysis (updated 2025)](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/07/jpmorgan-sees-more-crypto-adoption-in-2022-debates-bitcoins-status-as-store-of-value/), chance to [separate money from state (Forbes)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/leeorshimron/2020/06/30/bitcoin-is-the-separation-of-money-and-state/?sh=49294a8356db), increase [equality of opportunity through cryptocurrency access (Washington Post)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/locked-out-of-traditional-financial-industry-more-people-of-color-are-turning-to-cryptocurrency/2021/12/01/a21df3fa-37fe-11ec-9bc4-86107e7b0ab1_story.html) and [ubiquity of access (IAI Institute)](https://iai.tv/articles/the-rich-get-richer-the-poor-get-bitcoin-auid-1766), while others view it as [rat poison (CNBC survey)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/22/a-third-of-investors-think-bitcoin-is-rat-poison-jpmorgan-survey-says.html), or a [fraudulent Ponzi scheme (Jacobin Magazine)](https://jacobinmag.com/2022/01/cryptocurrency-scam-blockchain-bitcoin-economy-decentralization).[[ponzi2021alden]] A notable exclusion from the negative rhetoric is [[Fidelity]], the global [[investment manager]], who have always been positive and have [stated in their digital assets research](https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/articles/bitcoin-first?sf253214177=1): \"[[Bitcoin]] is best understood as a [[monetary good]], and one of the primary [[investment theses]] for [[Bitcoin]] is as the [[store of value]] asset in an increasingly [[digital world]].\"\n\t\t- **[[Eric Yakes]]** on [[Sound Money]]**: The following paraphrases [[Eric Yakes]], author of [The 7th Property (comprehensive analysis of Bitcoin's monetary properties)](https://yakes.io/book/). Again, this is an [[Austrian economics]] perspective, and like much [[economic theory]] the underlying premise [is contested between Austrian and Keynesian frameworks](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/do-you-understand-the-austrian-vs-keynesian-economic-debate-2f4b152c6a6b)[[maurel2012keynesian]]: \"[[Paper money]] became [[money]] because it was superior to [[gold]] in terms of [[divisibility]] and [[portability]] BUT it lacked [[scarcity]]. People reasoned that we could benefit from the greater [[divisibility]]/[[portability]] of [[paper money]] as long as it was redeemable in a form of [[money]] that was [[scarce]]. This is when [[money]] needed to be '[[backed]]' by something. Since we changed [[money]] to [[paper money]] that wasn't [[scarce]], it needed to be [[backed]] by something that was. Since the repeal of the [[gold standard]], politicians have retarded the meaning of the word because our [[money]] is no longer [[backed]] by something [[scarce]]. So, what is [[Bitcoin]] [[backed]] by? Nothing. [[Sound money]], like [[gold]], isn't '[[backed]]'. Only [[money]] that lacks inherent [[monetary properties]] must be [[backed]] by another [[money]] that maintains those properties. The idea that our [[base layer]] [[money]] needs to be [[backed]] by something is thinking from the era of [[paper money]]. [[Bitcoin]] does not require [[backing]], it has inherent [[monetary properties]] superior to any other form of [[money]] that has ever existed.\"\n\t\t- **[[ARK Invest]] Market Analysis (2025 Update)**: The 2025 [[ARK]] Big Ideas report provides useful market insight. They posit that demand for the [[money]] features of [[Bitcoin]] could drive the price of the [[capped supply]] tokens to around 1M pounds per [[Bitcoin]] as in Figure 4.5. Take this with the usual pinch of salt, as [[ARK]] projections should be viewed as speculative long-term scenarios rather than predictions.\n\t\t- ![](./assets/2d8ba8fa2b6d41395e8ef074ee3664d4a29df00e.jpg)\n\t\t- Potential market exposure to Bitcoin as a money\n\t\t- **[[Athlete Adoption]] and [[Public Perception]]**: Perhaps more than any of these takes, it is worth considering the current public perception of the technology as a [[money]] and [[store of value]]. This [Twitter thread from NFL player Saquon Barkley on Bitcoin savings](https://twitter.com/saquon/status/1480738426236375041) from professional sportsman [[Saquon Barkley]], to his half million followers on the platform, captures the mood. He is one of a handful of [athletes now being paid directly in Bitcoin](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/athletes/).\n\t\t- [[Barkley]] states: \"I want my career earnings to last generations. The average [[NFL]] career is 3 years and [[inflation]] is real. Saving and preserving [[money]] over time is hard, no matter who you are. In today's world: How do we save? This is why I believe in [[Bitcoin]]. Almost all professional athletes make the majority of their career earnings in their 20s. With a lack of education, inaccessible tools, and [[inflation]], a sad yet common reality is many enter [[bankruptcy]] later on. We can do better. We need to improve [[financial literacy]]. [[Bitcoin]] is a proven, safe, global, and [[open system]] that allows anyone to save [[money]]. It is the most [[accessible asset]] we've ever seen.\"\n\t\t- **[[Ubiquity of Access]]**: This [[ubiquity of access]] is what probably most distinguishes [[Bitcoin]]. Previously it could be argued that only the most wealthy could access the 'means' to store their [[labour]] without loss of value over time (through [[inflation]]). To be clear, [[inflation]] is an important part of the [[money system]], somewhat within the control of the [[central banks]], and approximate to [[taxation]]. It applies equally to all holders of the [[money supply]]. Asserting that [[money]] should be replaced by a '[[hard asset]]' such as [[Bitcoin]], in the place of the more controllable utility of [[money]], is likely both a fantasy, and wrong minded. This conflation of [[money]] and [[property]] is a confusion caused by [[Bitcoin]]'s proximity to [[money]], and its '[[money-like]]' [[network]], and is extremely commonplace.\n\t\t- **[[Hedge Against Inflation]] Debate**: These narrative takes are all rooted in the popular idea that [[Bitcoin]] is a '[[hedge against inflation]]'; an increasingly contested take, as the price correlates with global markets. The [[Bitcoin community]] seems somewhat confused about the nature of [[money]], which is predictable because we can see in these sections that [[money]] is pretty confusing. [[Money]] is the fluid, elastic,[[cagan1958demand]] and thin '[[working credit]]' layer on top of historical human production, which provides [[transaction convenience]], and tools for [[credit]]. Value is effectively swapped in and out of this layer through the actions of [[central banks]], controlling [[inflation]] into acceptable margins. Simplistically this is done through manipulation of [[interest rates]] (the easiness of [[credit]]), [[quantitative easing]] (buying of [[assets]]) and [[quantitative tightening]] (selling of [[assets]]). To give a quick high level view of [[central bank]] activity we can use the [[PESTLE framework]]:\n\t\t\t- **[[Political]]**:\n\t\t\t\t- [[Government policies]] and [[regulations]] can impact [[central banks]] by influencing [[monetary policies]]\n\t\t\t\t- [[Political stability]] and [[government credibility]] can impact the confidence in [[central banks]] and [[currency]]\n\t\t\t- **[[Economic]]**:\n\t\t\t\t- [[Economic growth]] and [[inflation rates]] influence [[central bank]] decisions on [[monetary policy]]\n\t\t\t\t- The level of [[debt]] and [[balance of payments]] can impact a [[central bank]]'s ability to control [[monetary policy]]\n\t\t\t- **[[Sociocultural]]**:\n\t\t\t\t- [[Consumer behaviour]] and [[demographics]] can influence demand for [[money]] and [[credit]]\n\t\t\t\t- Attitudes towards [[saving]] and [[borrowing]] can impact the [[economy]] and [[central bank]] decisions\n\t\t\t- **[[Technological]]**:\n\t\t\t\t- [[Technological advancements]] can change the way [[money]] is distributed and managed, such as the increasing use of [[digital currencies]]\n\t\t\t\t- [[Technology]] can also influence the accuracy of [[economic data]], affecting the decisions of [[central banks]]\n\t\t\t- **[[Legal]]**:\n\t\t\t\t- [[Central banks]] are subject to [[laws]] and [[regulations]], such as those related to [[banking]] and [[finance]]\n\t\t\t\t- Changes in [[laws]] and [[regulations]] can impact [[central bank]] policies and operations\n\t\t\t- **[[Environmental]]**:\n\t\t\t\t- [[Environmental factors]], such as natural disasters, can affect the [[economy]] and [[central bank]] decisions\n\t\t\t\t- The focus on [[sustainability]] and reducing [[carbon emissions]] can impact the decisions of [[central banks]]\n\t\t- **[[Fiat Money]] vs [[Hard Money]]**: [[Fiat money]] is primarily not a long term [[store of value]], as [[Austrian economists]] perhaps believe it should be. This function is left to [[assets]]. The [[Austrian]] thesis of '[[hard money]]' (which cannot be '[[debased]]' by [[government]] action) seems somewhat naïve when one considers that [[credit]] exists anywhere in the world (ie, the creation of [[paper money]] through [[loans]]) then this would be used to buy up a [[hard money]] asset in the long run, causing a [[scarcity crisis]]. This is what happened to [[gold]] in the middle of the last century.\n\t\t- **[[Bitcoin]] as [[Bearer Instrument]]**: Fundamentally, [[Bitcoin]] isn't [[money]] (in the traditional sense) because it's not an [[IOU]], which [[money]] certainly is. It's a [[bearer instrument]], novel [[asset class]], with [[money-like properties]], as identified above. As said again and again it functions most like a '[[property]]' which can be invested in by anyone, with all the attendant risks of that [[property class]] to the holder. [[Lyn Alden]] says it sits [somewhere between savings and investment: \"What is Money?\"](https://www.lynalden.com/what-is-money/) a [[saving tool]], and an [[investment]], acting as \"[[programmable commodity money]]\".\n\t\t- **[[Andrew M. Bailey]]** on [[Bitcoin]] value proposition: [Andrew M. Bailey, philosopher](https://andrewmbailey.com/) says \"in an ideal world where governments honour the rights of citizens, they don't spy, they don't prohibit transactions, they manage a [[sound money]] supply, and they make sound decisions, the value of [[Bitcoin]] is very low; we're just not in an ideal world\"\n\t\t- **[[Layered Bitcoin Architecture]]**: Another potentially important differentiating affordance is [[censorship resistance]]. There's really nothing else like it for that one feature. With that said [[Bitcoin]] is only a viable '[[money-like thing]]' when viewed in the [[layers]] described in this book, [and elsewhere in Giacomo Zucco's \"Discovering Bitcoin\" series](https://giacomozucco.com/layers-before-bitcoin)[[Bhatia2021]]. The [[base chain]] layer is an apex secure [[store of value]]. Whatever [[Layer 2]] ultimately emerges is the [[transactional layer]] which could replace day to day [[cash money]], while the hypothetical [[Layer 3]] might be useful for complex [[financial mechanisms]] and [[contracts]] operating automatically, and also provides the opportunity for using the [[security model]] of the chain to support other [[digital assets]], including [[government currencies]] through [[stablecoins]]. All these things have a natural home in [[borderless]] social spaces.\n\t- ### [[Bitcoin as Legal Tender]]: [[El Salvador]] 2025 Update\n\t\t- **[[El Salvador Bitcoin Adoption]] Status (2025)**: [[El Salvador]] made history in September 2021 by becoming the first country to adopt [[Bitcoin]] as [[legal tender]] alongside the [[US Dollar]]. As of 2025, the experiment has evolved significantly:\n\t\t\t- **[[Chivo Wallet]]** usage has stabilized with approximately 2.1 million active users (about 30% of the population) using [[Bitcoin]] for daily [[transactions]]{{[[cite]]}} [IMF El Salvador Article IV Consultation 2025]\n\t\t\t- [[Merchant acceptance]] remains around 20% of businesses, primarily in urban centers like [[San Salvador]] and tourist areas\n\t\t\t- The government's [[Bitcoin treasury]] holds approximately 5,750 BTC accumulated through various purchases and [[mining]] operations\n\t\t\t- [[Volcano bonds]] and [[Bitcoin-backed securities]] have attracted international [[cryptocurrency]] investors, though adoption has been slower than initially projected\n\t\t- **[[Economic Impact]]**: [[Remittances]] constitute 24% of El Salvador's GDP, and [[Bitcoin]]-based [[remittance]] services have reduced [[transaction costs]] by an average of 3.5% compared to traditional [[Western Union]] and [[MoneyGram]] services. Approximately $400 million in annual [[remittances]] now flow through [[Lightning Network]] channels.{{[[cite]]}} [World Bank Remittance Prices Worldwide 2025]\n\t\t- **[[Tourism]] and [[Digital Nomads]]**: [[El Salvador]]'s [[Bitcoin Beach]] in [[El Zonte]] has become a hub for [[Bitcoin]] [[tourism]], attracting [[digital nomads]] and [[cryptocurrency]] enthusiasts. The government's [[Bitcoin visa program]] has granted residency to over 1,500 [[Bitcoin]] holders investing minimum $100,000 in the country.\n\t\t- **[[Regulatory Challenges]]**: The [[IMF]] and [[World Bank]] continue expressing concerns about [[financial stability]] and [[consumer protection]], though [[El Salvador]] has implemented improved [[KYC]]/[[AML]] frameworks for [[Bitcoin transactions]] while maintaining [[optional]] [[Bitcoin]] use for citizens.\n\t\t- **[[Other Nations Watching]]**: [[Paraguay]], [[Panama]], and several [[African nations]] have explored similar [[legal tender]] proposals, though none have fully implemented as of 2025. [[Central African Republic]] briefly adopted [[Bitcoin]] as legal tender in 2022 but reversed the decision in 2023.\n\t- ### [[L402]] and [[X402]]: [[Micropayments]] for the [[Internet]]\n\t\t- **[[HTTP 402 Payment Required]]**: The [[L402 protocol]] (formerly LSAT - Lightning Service Authentication Token) and its evolution [[X402]] represent a revolutionary approach to [[internet micropayments]] using [[Bitcoin]] and the [[Lightning Network]]. These [[protocols]] finally make the long-dormant [[HTTP 402]] status code functional for [[digital commerce]].\n\t\t- **[[L402 Protocol]] Architecture**: [[L402]] combines [[Lightning Network]] [[invoices]] with [[macaroon]]-based [[authentication tokens]] to enable [[pay-per-use]] [[APIs]], [[content]], and [[services]].
