Recommended for organizing AI-generated ideas and notes long-term.\n\t\t\t\t- **Mermaid:** Diagram-as-code tool that AI (like Gemini) can generate output for (e.g., Gantt charts). Useful for structured visualization.\n\t\t\t\t- **Vectorworks:** existing design software. AI integration is currently limited by Vectorworks itself, but internal plugins might exist (like style transfer).\n\t\t- ### Core Concepts & Insights\n\t\t\t- **AI as a Productivity Multiplier:** AI can significantly speed up tasks like drafting text, generating ideas, creating initial visuals, and summarizing information.\n\t\t\t- **The \"Jagged Frontier\":** AI capabilities are inconsistent and change rapidly. Some tasks work well, others fail unexpectedly. Don't assume uniform competence.\n\t\t\t- **Hyper-Personalization:** AI enables tailoring outputs (designs, presentations, communication) specifically to individual client styles, preferences, and contexts (e.g., matching design visuals to a client's home art style). This is a key value proposition.\n\t\t\t- **Shift in Human Value:** As AI handles more tasks, human value shifts towards:\n\t\t\t\t- Personal relationships and trust.\n\t\t\t\t- Risk management and accountability (clients hire *you*, not the AI).\n\t\t\t\t- Expert oversight, curation, and refinement of AI outputs.\n\t\t\t\t- Understanding client needs deeply (the \"why\").\n\t\t\t\t- Creative direction and strategic thinking.\n\t\t\t- **Information Overload:** AI makes generating information easy, increasing the need for effective information management strategies.\n\t\t\t- **AI Doesn't Replace Expertise (Yet):** AI can generate plausible content but requires knowledgeable human oversight to check accuracy, relevance, and quality (e.g., checking plant suitability, design principles).\n\t\t- ### Practical Advice & Strategies\n\t\t\t- **Start with Gemini:** Focus initial efforts on learning and integrating Gemini due to its ecosystem integration and suitability for core business tasks.\n\t\t\t- **Embrace Experimentation:** Be prepared to try things, fail quickly, and iterate. Don't get discouraged if a prompt doesn't work; rephrase or try a different approach.\n\t\t\t- **Use Voice Interaction:** Leverage the Gemini mobile app's voice capabilities for note-taking, brainstorming, and information capture while on the go (walking, driving). Treat it like an advanced dictaphone that can also analyze and structure information.\n\t\t\t- **Develop Prompting Skills:**\n\t\t\t\t- Be specific with requests.\n\t\t\t\t- Provide context (e.g., target audience, desired style, constraints).\n\t\t\t\t- Define and reuse your own \"style\" (writing, design philosophy) as part of your prompts.\n\t\t\t\t- Iterate on prompts – refine them based on the output.\n\t\t\t\t- Don't be afraid to \"smash lots of words\" into the prompt; more (relevant) detail is often better.\n\t\t\t- **Leverage AI for Business Foundations:** Use AI immediately for tasks like:\n\t\t\t\t- Drafting business plans and marketing plans.\n\t\t\t\t- Market research and competitor analysis.\n\t\t\t\t- Generating ideas for lead generation.\n\t\t\t\t- Creating initial content for websites or social media.\n\t\t\t\t- Logo design concepts.\n\t\t\t- **Use AI for Design Assistance:**\n\t\t\t\t- Generate mood boards and concept visualizations quickly.\n\t\t\t\t- Create initial planting plans or Gantt charts (using Mermaid).\n\t\t\t\t- Generate stylized images based on sketches or concepts (potentially using ChatGPT for more control initially).\n\t\t\t\t- Explore AI for creating different visual perspectives or variations of a design idea.\n\t\t\t- **Integrate with Workflow:** Connect Gemini to Google Drive to allow it access to your documents for summarization, analysis, and writing tasks based on your data.\n\t\t\t- **Don't Over-Rely on Initial AI Output:** Treat AI output as a draft or starting point. Always review, edit, and refine based on your expertise. Don't read every word it generates initially; focus on the overall structure and key ideas.\n\t\t\t- **Prioritize Tasks:** Focus AI efforts on the most immediate business needs first (e.g., marketing, lead generation) before diving deep into more advanced applications (like complex image editing or video).\n\t\t- ### Learning & Development\n\t\t\t- **Expect a Learning Curve:** Allocate time (suggested 2-3 months) for dedicated exploration and practice to build confidence and proficiency.\n\t\t\t- **Play and Explore:** Regularly experiment with the tools (\"fiddle around\") to understand their capabilities and limitations. This is essential due to the rapid changes in AI.\n\t\t\t- **Focus on Confidence Building:** The initial phase is about getting comfortable talking to the AI, trying different prompts, and not being afraid of errors.\n\t\t\t- **Learn Markdown:** Useful for formatting AI outputs and using them in tools like Obsidian. Tell the AI to format responses in markdown.\n\t\t\t- **Stay Updated (Implicit):** The tools change constantly, requiring ongoing learning.\n\t\t- ### Business Applications (Garden Design Specific)\n\t\t\t- **Client Consultation Prep/Follow-up:** Transcribe and summarise meeting notes (using local AI on phone or Gemini).\n\t\t\t- **Concept Generation:** Quickly create mood boards, visual concepts, and planting ideas based on client needs and site photos.\n\t\t\t- **Visualization:** Generate stylized images of proposed designs, potentially matching the client's aesthetic (using their home/art as inspiration). Create different views (e.g., top-down plan from a perspective sketch).\n\t\t\t- **Planning & Scheduling:** Generate Gantt charts (via Mermaid) for project timelines.\n\t\t\t- **Plant Information:** Quickly look up plant details (Latin names, care requirements, soil pH) and generate care plans.\n\t\t\t- **Marketing Materials:** Draft website copy, social media posts, blog articles, marketing plans.\n\t\t\t- **Business Planning:** Assist in writing the business plan, analyzing the market.\n\t\t\t- **Lead Generation:** Research potential clients (e.g., finding recent planning applications in specific areas - though agentic capabilities are future-facing, analysis of documents is possible).\n\t\t\t- **Logo/Branding Ideas:** Generate initial concepts for branding.\n\t\t- ### Information Management\n\t\t\t- **Challenge:** AI generates vast amounts of information quickly, making organization crucial.\n\t\t\t- **Strategy:** Develop a system to capture and retrieve valuable AI interactions and outputs.\n\t\t\t- **Tools:**\n\t\t\t\t- **Markdown:** Use as a standard format for notes.\n\t\t\t\t- **Obsidian:** Recommended for building a personal knowledge base, linking ideas, and storing notes long-term.\n\t\t\t\t- **Google Drive:** Use for storing documents and potentially allowing Gemini access.\n\t\t\t- **Process:** Be deliberate about saving useful AI conversations/outputs and potentially tagging or linking them for future reference (e.g., saving a good prompt, storing generated text in Obsidian).\n\t- DOING It takes a couple of months of pretty serious exploration to find where you are comfortable with AI.\n\t\t- [[Gemini]]\n\t- DOING It typically takes a couple of months of focused exploration to become comfortable with AI tools and workflows.\n\t- {{embed ((66f3fee3-6b3f-48df-b61b-2ba06e75b1b4))}}\n\t- ## Information Management\n\t\t- It will ALWAYS help the AI for have more data about you. This can be done in a few ways\n\t\t- ### Cloud AI versus On-Premise Models\n\t\t\t- DONE Cloud services offer simplicity and scale, whereas self-hosted models (e.g. running Stable Diffusion locally or deploying your own LLM) give you full control over data and costs.\n\t\t- ### DONE In-Context Training (think ChatGPT memory)\n\t\t\t- DOING [[Gemini]] connected to Google Drive and all you data.\n\t\t\t- DONE Loading data inline on each session gives precise control but can be time-consuming and requires expertise. Alternatively the platforms can manage this for you.\n\t\t\t- DONE Available free with the [[ChatGPT]] tool. Convenient, but you may find it hard to separate business and personal content, and the process is largely a black box.\n\t\t- ### DONE Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n\t\t\t- DONE [[Retrieval Augmented Generation - RAG]] - Combines your own document store with AI retrieval. Steeper learning curve, but extremely powerful over the medium term for keeping knowledge up to date.\n\t\t- ### Tools for Notes and Knowledge\n\t\t\t- ‘[Markitdown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown)’ for converting Microsoft docs to Markdown\n\t\t\t- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) or Logseq for personal knowledge bases\n\t\t\t- DOING Notion for collaborative wikis\n\t\t- ### DOING Knowledge Graphs\n\t\t\t- [[Knowledge Graphing]] can help you to organise semi structured data.\n\t\t\t- DOING Obsidian\n\t\t\t- DONE Logseq\n\t\t\t- DONE Notion\n- # Media Creation\n\t- ## DOING Images\n\t\t- Landscape renders using custom Stable Diffusion LoRAs (for example, JJ’s Landscape Render, StreetScape and Ecology Park models on Civitai)\n\t\t- General tools such as Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and DALL·E 3\n\t\t\t- ![image.png](../assets/image_1745922516312_0.png)\n\t\t\t- ![ChatGPT Image Apr 29, 2025, 11_37_28 AM.png](../assets/ChatGPT_Image_Apr_29,_2025,_11_37_28_AM_1745923062112_0.png)\n\t\t- [[Image Generation]]\n\t\t\t- Image processing from drawings\n\t\t- [JJ's Landscape Render - XL v1.0 | Stable Diffusion XL LoRA | Civitai](https://civitai.com/models/257038/jjs-landscape-render)\n\t\t- [JJs StreetScape - XL v1.0 | Stable Diffusion XL LoRA | Civitai](https://civitai.com/models/306671?modelVersionId=344231)\n\t\t- [JJs Ecology Park - XL v1.0 | Stable Diffusion XL LoRA | Civitai](https://civitai.com/models/306688?modelVersionId=344250)\n\t- ## DOING Video\n\t\t- AI-assisted tools like Sustainable Home Visuals AI\n\t\t- Experimental generative video platforms (Runway ML Gen-2, PromeAI) for short concept clips\n\t\t- [Sustainable Home Visuals AI](https://chatgpt.com/c/680cfbe3-eb60-8005-946f-35b268702dab)\n\t\t\t- {{video https://youtu.be/0fzvIBO-yLw}}\n\t- ## Social Media and Marketing\n\t\t- Use [[social media]] planning tools to schedule posts and analyse engagement\n\t\t- Leverage QR codes (for example, AI-powered QR code generators) to link print and digital campaigns\n\t\t- [[social media]]\n\t\t- marketing grind [[Consumer Tools for SMEs]]\n\t\t- QR code\n\t\t\t- [AI QR Code Generator - Create Free QR in 2025](https://qrcode-ai.com/)\n- co-working engine (not quite sure what that one means)\n- # TODO Vectorworks Plan Visualisation\n\t- Modern AI can transform 2D Vectorworks plans into client-ready visuals in five key formats.\n\t- ## Renderings from Plan Drawings\n\t\t- **Vectorworks AI Visualizer** ([FAQ](https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/articles.html/articles/faqs/ai-visualizer/))\n\t\t\t- Works inside Vectorworks 2024+, using your active file or view plus a text prompt.\n\t\t\t- Ideal for quick concept iterations (materials, lighting variations).\n\t\t\t- Note: not CAD-accurate rendering but excellent for inspirational visuals.\n\t\t- **Veras AI for Vectorworks** ([EvolveLAB announcement](https://www.evolvelab.io/post/announcing-veras-ai-for-vectorworks))\n\t\t\t- Plugin that uses your 3D model or 2D viewport as a base.\n\t\t\t- Photorealistic or stylised renders in seconds with prompt-driven material and ambience overrides.\n\t\t- **Mainstream Text-to-Image Generators**\n\t\t\t- Export plan or massing views as PNG/JPG and feed into Midjourney, Stable Diffusion (with ControlNet) or DALL·E 3 for high-res concept images.\n\t\t\t- Best for early-stage mood boards rather than precise layouts.\n\t- ## Walkthrough Animations or Flythrough Videos\n\t\t- **Twinmotion** ([guide](https://www.vectorworks.net/en-US/newsroom/your-guide-to-rendering-with-twinmotion))\n\t\t\t- Real-time link via Datasmith; create MP4 or interactive 360 panoramas.\n\t\t\t- Supports AI-powered denoising and crowd/traffic generation.\n\t\t- **Enscape for Vectorworks** ([blog](https://blog.enscape3d.com/vectorworks-rendering))\n\t\t\t- Live rendering inside Vectorworks, with keyframe-based video export and VR standalone packages.\n\t\t- **Experimental AI Video Tools**\n\t\t\t- Runway ML Gen-2 or PromeAI for short motion clips from still frames (low resolution but quick concept demos).\n\t- ## Stylised Artistic Illustrations\n\t\t- Use AI style-transfer plugins (such as Veras prompts for ‘watercolour sketch’ or ‘ink outline’)\n\t\t- Export views to image-to-image tools (Midjourney, Stable Diffusion with community style models) for watercolour, pencil or comic-book effects\n\t\t- Adobe Firefly in Photoshop for generative fill on SVG/PDF exports (text-to-image room textures, decorative elements)\n\t- ## Immersive AR and VR Experiences\n\t\t- **Vectorworks Nomad** ([app](https://apps.apple.com/ch/app/vectorworks-nomad/id506706850?l=en-GB))\n\t\t\t- Markerless AR viewer on iOS/Android; place your model at 1 : 1 scale on site without coding.\n\t\t- **Desktop VR via Enscape or Twinmotion**\n\t\t\t- One-click VR export to headsets (Oculus, Vive) for real-time walkthroughs.\n\t\t- **Custom Game-Engine Solutions**\n\t\t\t- Import via Datasmith into Unreal Engine or FBX/OBJ into Unity for bespoke interactive apps.
