This approach aims to reduce latency and network congestion by performing computations and running applications on devices such as sensors, gateways, or edge servers located near the data source. By moving computational tasks closer to where the data is generated, edge compute enables real-time and low-latency decision-making.\n\t- Edge AI, also known as AI at the edge or on-device AI, refers to the deployment of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms on edge devices. By bringing AI capabilities closer to the data source, Edge AI eliminates the need to transmit large volumes of data to the cloud for processing. This approach enables real-time inference and decision-making directly on devices with limited computing resources, such as smartphones, drones, or IoT devices. Edge AI has several advantages, including reduced latency, improved privacy and security, offline functionality, and the ability to operate in disconnected or bandwidth-constrained environments.\n\t- Fog compute, on the other hand, extends the concept of edge compute by introducing a hierarchical architecture. It involves distributing computing resources, storage, and applications between the cloud and edge devices. In the fog computing model, intermediate fog nodes are deployed between edge devices and the cloud, enabling them to process and store data. This approach reduces the need for data to be transmitted to traditional data centers or the cloud, allowing for faster response times, increased security, and better bandwidth utilization.\n\t- Overall, the combination of edge compute, fog compute, and edge AI introduces a distributed computing paradigm that brings processing, storage, and intelligence closer to the data source. This not only improves performance and efficiency but also enables new use cases and applications in various domains, including IoT, smart cities, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation.\n\t- These systems will drive the compute to less ‘constrained’ but somewhat less capable AI systems, distributing the access but increasing risks.
