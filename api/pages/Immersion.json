(1997). \"A Framework for Immersive Virtual Environments (FIVE): Speculations on the Role of Presence in Virtual Environments.\" *Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments*, 6(6), 603-616.

[Online]\n- Ongoing research focuses on:\n  - Enhancing sensory realism through multimodal feedback (visual, auditory, haptic).\n  - Developing non-invasive BCIs to enable thought-controlled navigation and interaction.\n  - Balancing immersion intensity with cognitive load to optimise learning and user comfort.\n  - Addressing privacy and ethical challenges inherent in neural data collection.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK contributes robustly to immersive technology research and application, with universities and companies leading in VR innovation.\n  - Manchester’s digital innovation district supports startups developing immersive training and healthcare solutions.\n  - Leeds hosts initiatives integrating VR into cultural heritage preservation and education.\n  - Newcastle University explores VR rehabilitation therapies, combining immersion with clinical research.\n  - Sheffield’s VR labs focus on industrial applications, including virtual prototyping and safety training.\n- Regional case studies demonstrate successful deployment of immersive VR in NHS training programmes and museum exhibitions.\n- The UK government and research councils fund projects emphasising ethical design and inclusive access to immersive technologies.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include:\n  - Integration of **AI-driven adaptive environments** that respond dynamically to user behaviour and emotional state.\n  - Development of ultra-light mixed reality (MR) headsets improving comfort and usability.\n  - Expansion of professional metaverse workspaces facilitating remote collaboration.\n  - Progress in brain-computer interfaces, although full-dive VR remains a distant goal, possibly 30-50 years away.\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Ensuring user privacy and data security in neural and behavioural data collection.\n  - Managing cognitive overload and motion sickness in highly immersive experiences.\n  - Bridging the digital divide to prevent exclusion from immersive technology benefits.\n- Research priorities:\n  - Refining multimodal sensory integration to enhance presence without overwhelming users.\n  - Establishing ethical frameworks for neural interface use.\n  - Investigating long-term psychological effects of sustained immersion.\n\n## References\n\n1.
