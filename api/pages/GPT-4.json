(2017), underpins GPT-4’s design.\n    - Subsequent research has focused on scaling, multimodal fusion, and reasoning capabilities.\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Notable organisations and platforms\n    - OpenAI, Microsoft, Google DeepMind, Anthropic, and Meta AI have all integrated GPT-4 and its successors into their products and services.\n    - Microsoft Copilot Studio, for example, transitioned to GPT-4.1 as the default model for newly created agents in October 2025.\n  - UK and North England examples where relevant\n    - In Manchester, the University of Manchester’s AI research group has leveraged GPT-4 for natural language processing tasks in healthcare and education.\n    - Leeds City Council has piloted GPT-4-powered chatbots for citizen services, enhancing accessibility and efficiency.\n    - Newcastle University’s School of Computing Science has used GPT-4 in research projects focused on multimodal data analysis.\n    - Sheffield Hallam University has integrated GPT-4 into its digital learning platforms, supporting students and staff with advanced AI tools.\n- Technical capabilities and limitations\n  - GPT-4 excels in handling complex, nuanced instructions and can process both text and images, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.\n  - The model’s context window has been expanded to support up to 1 million tokens, allowing for more comprehensive and coherent long-form content generation.\n  - Limitations include occasional inaccuracies in factual recall and the need for careful prompt engineering to achieve optimal results.\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Industry standards for model evaluation, such as SWE-bench Verified and Scale’s MultiChallenge, have been adopted to benchmark GPT-4’s performance.\n  - Frameworks for multimodal fusion and reasoning training have been developed to enhance the model’s capabilities.\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers and sources\n  - Vaswani, A., Shazeer, N., Parmar, N., Uszkoreit, J., Jones, L., Gomez, A.
