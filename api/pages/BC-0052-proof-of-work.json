The continued energy consumption growth—seemingly paradoxical given reduced mining revenue—reflected:\n\n  - **Hash rate growth**: Bitcoin's network hash rate grew from approximately 500 EH/s pre-halving to 615 EH/s by early 2025, driven by ASIC efficiency improvements (35-40% electricity cost reduction per hash) and Bitcoin price appreciation (offsetting halving impacts)\n  - **Efficiency gains insufficient to offset scale**: Whilst newer-generation ASIC miners (18-23 J/TH vs. 30-35 J/TH for older models) reduced electricity per hash unit, the **absolute number of hashes computed grew faster**, resulting in net energy consumption increases\n  - **Renewable energy percentage insufficient**: Although renewable energy usage in Bitcoin mining reached **54% by 2025** (up from approximately 40% in 2021), this represented the **energy source mix** rather than absolute consumption reduction—total fossil fuel electricity consumed still increased in absolute terms despite declining as a percentage\n\n  The **1,335 kWh per transaction metric** remained controversial amongst Bitcoin proponents, who argued this measurement was misleading:\n\n  - **Security, not transactions**: Bitcoin's energy consumption secures the **entire network and settlement layer**, not individual transactions. The same energy would be consumed whether Bitcoin processed 100,000 or 1 million transactions per day, as energy correlates with block production (every ~10 minutes) rather than transaction count.\n  - **Layer 2 multiplier**: The Lightning Network and other Layer 2 solutions enable theoretically unlimited transactions atop Bitcoin's base layer, potentially amortising energy costs across millions of additional transactions not captured in on-chain metrics.\n  - **False equivalence**: Comparing Bitcoin's energy consumption to \"households powered\" or \"countries' electricity use\" created intuitive but potentially misleading framings, as Bitcoin mining often utilised **curtailed renewable energy** (otherwise wasted), **stranded gas** (otherwise flared), or **off-peak baseload power** (otherwise sold at negative prices)—energy contexts where marginal environmental cost differed substantially from displacing residential electricity.\n\n  Critics countered that these defences constituted **special pleading**: no other industry justified extreme energy consumption by citing theoretical future efficiency layers or marginal utilisation of waste streams.\n\n  ### Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake Merge: 99.9% Reduction Vindicated\n\n  Ethereum's **September 15, 2022 transition** from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake (PoS)—known as **\"The Merge\"**—achieved full vindication by 2024-2025 as the network demonstrated:\n\n  **Energy Reduction Sustained:**\n  - Ethereum's annual energy consumption remained at approximately **0.02 TWh** through 2024-2025, representing a **99.9% reduction** from pre-Merge levels (approximately 96 TWh in 2021-2022)\n  - This energy consumption level equated to approximately **2,600 U.S. households' annual electricity use**, compared to Bitcoin's equivalent of **19.4 million households**—a **7,500x difference** for networks with comparable market capitalisation ($200-300 billion for Ethereum vs. $600 billion-$1 trillion for Bitcoin during 2024-2025)\n\n  **Security and Decentralisation Maintained:**\n  - By early 2025, over **1,000,000 validators** participated in Ethereum's proof-of-stake consensus, staking approximately **32 million ETH** (approximately 27% of total supply, valued at $50-80 billion depending on ETH price)\n  - The network experienced **zero consensus failures** or **51% attacks** since The Merge, demonstrating that proof-of-stake's economic security model (requiring attackers to acquire and risk substantial capital) functioned effectively in practice\n  - **Decentralisation concerns** persisted: Lido (liquid staking protocol) controlled approximately **30% of staked ETH**, whilst Coinbase controlled approximately **13%**—creating centralisation risks if these entities coordinated or faced regulatory capture. However, no consensus attacks materialised despite these concentrations.\n\n  **Economic Sustainability:**\n  - Ethereum validators earned approximately **3-4% annual yield** (varying with network activity and MEV—miner extractable value), providing sufficient economic incentives for participation without requiring proof-of-work's massive energy expenditure\n  - The **deflationary tokenomics** introduced post-Merge (EIP-1559 burns base transaction fees) created a dynamic where network usage could reduce total ETH supply, potentially enhancing long-term value accrual and validator incentives\n\n  **Broader Ecosystem Validation:**\n  - Ethereum's successful Merge demonstrated that **major blockchain networks could transition consensus mechanisms** without catastrophic failure, providing an existence proof that energy-intensive proof-of-work was **not technically necessary** for securing high-value decentralised networks\n  - This vindication substantially weakened proof-of-work defenders' argument that proof-of-stake was \"unproven\" or \"theoretically insecure\"—by 2025, Ethereum had operated under proof-of-stake for over **2.5 years** securing hundreds of billions in value without incident\n\n  ### Proof-of-Stake Alternatives: Demonstrating Marginal Energy Consumption\n\n  By 2024-2025, proof-of-stake networks across the cryptocurrency ecosystem demonstrated that **blockchain consensus could operate at marginal energy scales**:\n\n  **Leading PoS Networks' Energy Consumption (2025 estimates):**\n  - **Polkadot**: Approximately **70 MWh annually** (0.00007 TWh)—equivalent to approximately **8 U.S. households**\n  - **Cardano**: Approximately **0.007 TWh annually** (7,000 MWh)—equivalent to approximately **800 U.S. households**\n  - **Solana**: Approximately **0.002 TWh annually** (1,967 MWh)—equivalent to approximately **225 U.S. households**\n  - **Avalanche**: Approximately **0.003 TWh annually**—equivalent to approximately **350 U.S. households**\n\n  These networks collectively secured **over $50 billion in market capitalisation** whilst consuming energy equivalent to **fewer than 2,000 U.S. households**—a **resource efficiency profile** 10,000x superior to Bitcoin on a per-dollar-secured basis.\n\n  **Carbon Footprint Comparison:**\n  - The Climate Chain Coalition's research institute (CCRI) estimated yearly carbon footprints for major proof-of-stake networks:\n    - **Polkadot**: 33 tonnes CO₂e annually\n    - **Solana**: 934 tonnes CO₂e annually\n    - **Cardano**: Approximately 200 tonnes CO₂e annually\n  - In contrast, Bitcoin's carbon footprint (assuming global electricity grid average carbon intensity of 0.4 tonnes CO₂/MWh) exceeded **69 million tonnes CO₂e annually** in 2025—equivalent to the annual emissions of **Switzerland** or **New Zealand**\n\n  **Performance and Scalability:**\n  - Proof-of-stake networks consistently demonstrated **superior transaction throughput** and **lower latency** compared to Bitcoin:\n    - **Solana**: 2,000-5,000 transactions per second (TPS) sustained, with theoretical capacity exceeding 50,000 TPS\n    - **Avalanche**: 4,500 TPS with sub-second finality\n    - **Cardano**: 250+ TPS following 2024 scaling upgrades\n    - **Bitcoin**: 7 TPS base layer (though Lightning Network Layer 2 could handle substantially more)\n\n  - This performance differential undermined arguments that proof-of-work's energy consumption was **technologically necessary** for blockchain functionality—proof-of-stake networks achieved orders of magnitude better performance per unit energy consumed.\n\n  ### Regulatory Pressures and Environmental Governance\n\n  Despite renewable energy adoption progress, proof-of-work mining faced **intensifying regulatory scrutiny** globally through 2024-2025:\n\n  **EU MiCA Regulation (December 2024):**\n  - The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, which became fully effective in **December 2024**, established comprehensive standards for cryptocurrency operations across the European Union\n  - **Environmental disclosure requirements**: Crypto-asset service providers (including exchanges listing proof-of-work cryptocurrencies) must disclose energy consumption and environmental impact data, creating transparency obligations\n  - **No outright PoW ban**: Despite pressure from the European Central Bank and environmental groups, MiCA stopped short of banning proof-of-work mining or trading, representing a **political compromise** between innovation advocates and climate hawks\n  - **Future restrictions remain possible**: MiCA includes provisions for **future amendments** based on evolving environmental assessments, leaving open the possibility of stricter measures if proof-of-work energy consumption continues growing\n\n  **Geographic Bans and Restrictions:**\n  - **Kuwait banned mining entirely in 2025** due to power grid strain from summer air conditioning demand (peak temperatures exceeding 50°C), joining a growing list of nations imposing energy-infrastructure-driven bans\n  - **Russia introduced seasonal mining bans** in select regions (particularly Siberia) during winter peak electricity demand, whilst paradoxically positioning itself as a mining destination during other periods\n  - **Iceland**, historically a mining haven due to abundant geothermal and hydro energy, witnessed growing **community resistance** as mining facilities competed with tourism, data centres, and aluminium smelting for limited grid capacity despite 100% renewable electricity\n\n  **U.S. Regulatory Reversal:**\n  - The **Trump administration's abandonment** of the proposed 30% Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME) tax represented the most significant regulatory shift, signalling that U.S. federal policy would **not penalise proof-of-work mining** for energy consumption\n  - This reversal created a **regulatory arbitrage opportunity**: miners concentrated in pro-mining U.S. states (Texas, Wyoming, Arkansas) and countries with favourable policies, whilst exiting hostile jurisdictions (New York, parts of Europe)\n\n  ### Health and Environmental Justice: The Granbury Precedent\n\n  The environmental debate evolved beyond abstract energy consumption metrics toward **localised health impacts** affecting mining facility neighbours:\n\n  **PM2.5 Pollution and Public Health:**\n  - A **May 2025 study in Nature Communications** indicated that demand from 34 large U.S. Bitcoin mining facilities increased fine particulate matter (**PM2.5**) pollution, affecting approximately **1.9 million people**\n  - The mechanism: mining facilities' electricity demand led utilities to operate fossil fuel power plants (particularly natural gas peaker plants) at higher capacity during peak mining periods, increasing emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, and particulate matter\n  - Estimated health costs: The study calculated approximately **$1,000-1,500 in health damages per Bitcoin** mined when accounting for respiratory illness, cardiovascular disease exacerbation, and premature mortality linked to PM2.5 exposure\n\n  **Noise Pollution Litigation:**\n  - The **October 2024 Granbury, Texas lawsuit** against Marathon Digital Holdings marked a watershed: residents alleged 24/7 noise from mining facility cooling fans (measured at 70-80 decibels at property lines) caused **sleep deprivation, stress, and diminished property values**\n  - The lawsuit framed mining operations as a **private nuisance** and potential **public health hazard**, seeking facility shutdowns and damages. By early 2025, the case remained in pre-trial discovery, but similar lawsuits emerged in **Montana**, **North Dakota**, and rural areas of **Kazakhstan**\n  - **Regulatory response**: Arkansas proposed 2024 regulations requiring mining facilities to maintain noise levels below 55 decibels at property lines during night-time hours (10pm-7am), with some municipalities considering outright bans on facilities within 1 mile of residential areas\n\n  **Water Consumption in Arid Regions:**\n  - Mining facilities using **evaporative cooling** in water-scarce regions (West Texas, Southwest U.S., parts of Kazakhstan) faced growing criticism for consuming **1-2 gallons per kWh**—potentially millions of gallons daily for large facilities\n  - **Industry response**: Adoption of **immersion cooling technologies** (95% water reduction) and **air cooling in humid climates** addressed concerns in newer facilities, but legacy operations continued using evaporative systems due to retrofit costs ($5-15 million per facility)\n\n  ### The Greenwashing Debate: Renewable Energy Claims Under Scrutiny\n\n  As Bitcoin mining industry claims of \"54% renewable energy\" became standard marketing, critics intensified **greenwashing accusations**:\n\n  **Renewable Energy Credit (REC) Controversy:**\n  - Many miners achieved renewable energy percentages by purchasing **Renewable Energy Certificates** (RECs)—financial instruments representing the renewable attributes of electricity generation—whilst actually consuming fossil fuel electricity\n  - Critics argued this practice provided **zero climate benefit**: the renewable electricity generation and fossil fuel consumption both occurred, merely with financial accounting transferring renewable \"credits\" to miners\n  - **Analogy**: A coal plant could claim 100% renewable electricity by purchasing sufficient RECs, whilst literally burning coal—highlighting the disconnect between REC accounting and physical emissions reduction\n\n  **Load Displacement and System Effects:**\n  - Environmental economists argued that even miners **directly consuming renewable electricity** at wind/solar farms imposed **system-level costs**:\n    - Mining load increased **total system electricity demand**, necessitating additional generation capacity (often fossil fuel backup) to maintain grid reliability\n    - Renewable electricity consumed by miners represented **opportunity cost**—that same electricity could have displaced fossil fuel generation elsewhere on the grid, creating greater net emissions reduction\n  - Miners countered that **curtailed renewable energy** (otherwise wasted due to transmission constraints) had **zero opportunity cost**, as it would not have served other loads regardless\n\n  **Methane Mitigation Overstated:**\n  - Mining operations co-located with landfills, oil wells, and wastewater treatment plants claimed **climate-positive impacts** by capturing vented methane (80x more potent than CO₂ over 20-year timeframes)\n  - Critics argued these claims overstated benefits:\n    - Methane capture for electricity generation still produced CO₂ emissions\n    - Mining created economic incentives for **continued fossil fuel extraction** (oil wells kept operating longer to supply associated gas for mining), undermining climate transition\n    - **Scale limitations**: Methane-powered mining represented only approximately **5-8%** of total Bitcoin mining by 2025—too small to offset the network's overall climate impact\n\n  ### Technical Alternatives and Proof-of-Work's Obsolescence Debate\n\n  By 2024-2025, the technical community divided sharply on whether proof-of-work remained **necessary** for Bitcoin's specific security model:\n\n  **Pro-Proof-of-Work Arguments:**\n  - **Thermodynamic security**: Proof-of-work's energy expenditure creates a **physical cost floor** for attacking the network (must expend equivalent energy to rewrite history), providing security assurances independent of token price or staking economics\n  - **Decentralisation**: Mining hardware can be purchased by anyone globally without permissioned access, whereas proof-of-stake concentrates power amongst large token holders (potential plutocracy)\n  - **Lindy effect**: Bitcoin's proof-of-work has operated continuously for **16+ years** without consensus failure, whilst proof-of-stake networks remain younger and potentially less battle-tested for Bitcoin's scale and value\n  - **No viable transition path**: Even if proof-of-stake were superior, transitioning Bitcoin would require unprecedented coordination and risk catastrophic governance failure or chain split\n\n  **Pro-Proof-of-Stake Arguments:**\n  - **Ethereum vindication**: Over 2.5 years post-Merge demonstrate proof-of-stake can secure high-value networks ($200-300 billion) with 99.9% less energy\n  - **Economic security sufficiency**: The **opportunity cost of capital** staked in proof-of-stake (foregoing alternative investments) plus **slashing risk** (validators lose staked capital for malicious behavior) provides equivalent security to proof-of-work's energy expenditure\n  - **Scalability and performance**: Proof-of-stake enables **higher throughput** and **faster finality** without energy constraints limiting validator participation\n  - **Environmental necessity**: Climate crisis urgency renders proof-of-work's energy consumption **ethically indefensible** regardless of technical arguments\n\n  **Alternative Consensus Mechanisms:**\n  - Research continued on hybrid approaches:\n    - **Proof-of-stake with proof-of-work checkpoints**: Using occasional proof-of-work \"anchors\" for finality whilst proof-of-stake handles routine consensus\n    - **Proof-of-useful-work**: Replacing SHA-256 hashing with computations providing societal value (protein folding, climate modelling)—though no implementations achieved Bitcoin-scale deployment\n    - **Proof-of-spacetime** (Chia, Filecoin): Using disk storage rather than computation—lower energy intensity but requiring massive storage infrastructure\n\n  None of these alternatives gained sufficient traction to challenge Bitcoin's entrenched proof-of-work or Ethereum's proof-of-stake dominance by 2025.\n\n  ### Future Trajectory: Persistence, Prohibition, or Phase-Out?\n\n  By mid-2025, proof-of-work's future remained deeply contested, with plausible scenarios including:\n\n  **Persistence Scenario (Base Case):**\n  - Bitcoin's proof-of-work continues indefinitely, benefiting from U.S. regulatory acceptance, renewable energy integration economics, and **thermodynamic security** narrative resilience\n  - Energy consumption stabilises around **200 TWh annually by 2027-2028** as ASIC efficiency approaches thermodynamic limits and hash rate growth plateaus\n  - Proof-of-work becomes a **Bitcoin-specific phenomenon**: no new major blockchains launch with proof-of-work (all use proof-of-stake or alternatives), but Bitcoin's incumbency and network effects sustain its model\n  - Environmental criticism persists but fails to achieve regulatory prohibition due to **geographic arbitrage** (mining concentrates in friendly jurisdictions) and **political lobbying** funded by institutional miners\n\n  **Prohibition Scenario (Regulatory Risk):**\n  - A severe climate event or political shift triggers **coordinated international action**: EU bans proof-of-work under updated MiCA provisions, multiple U.S. states impose moratoriums, China fully enforces 2021 ban\n  - Mining concentrates in **jurisdictions of last resort** (Russia, Central Asia, parts of Middle East/Africa) with limited renewable energy and weak governance, creating reputational damage\n  - Institutional capital divests from Bitcoin due to ESG concerns, reducing price and creating a **death spiral**: lower Bitcoin price → reduced mining profitability → declining hash rate → reduced security → further price decline\n  - Bitcoin potentially survives as a **niche asset** but loses aspirations of global reserve currency or mainstream institutional adoption\n\n  **Phase-Out Scenario (Technical Transition):**\n  - Growing consensus within Bitcoin community that energy consumption threatens long-term viability, leading to **controversial hard fork** transitioning to hybrid proof-of-work/proof-of-stake or full proof-of-stake\n  - This would represent Bitcoin's most contentious governance decision ever, likely creating **multiple chain splits** (proof-of-work maximalists continue original chain, proof-of-stake adopters fork to new chain)\n  - Market eventually converges on one chain as dominant, but transition creates years of uncertainty and value destruction\n  - **Probability assessed as low** (<20%) by 2025 due to entrenched proof-of-work ideology and lack of coordination mechanisms\n\n  **Technological Disruption Scenario (Quantum or Alternative):**\n  -

Their reportis titled “[VR Usage & Consumer Attitudes, WaveVI](https://artilleryiq.com/reports/vr-usage-consumer-attitudes-wave-vi/)”.In the USA (which is the cohort they surveyed) they found that adoptionof VR headsets is slower than predicted (their work is longitudinal),but steady. Some highlight points are:\n\t\t-\n\t - 23 percent of U.S. adults own or ithave used VR technology. This is around 4% up from the previous survey in 2020. Frustratingly, and very much in keeping with such industry surveys they conflate ‘own’ with ’have used’ making this data pretty meaningless from an adoption point of view.\n\t\t-\n\t - there is a skew toward male users of around 10%, and a far larger skew toward younger users, and a bias toward richer households. These are indicative of a technology that’s still early in it’s adoption cycle.\n\t\t-\n\t - Of the owners of the technology (no indication what percentage this is) they found that around a third used the equipment regularly, but that this retention number was gently falling.\n\t\t-\n\t - Standalone headsets (Quest 2 and Pico 4) without a cabled connection to a computer are far more popular, and have better user retention. This makes sense as the alternative demands either space or setup time.\n\t\t-\n\t - Buyers of these more popular headsets are very sensitive to price. Note here that Meta is selling Quest2 at a loss to drive the market. This is unsustainable.\n\t\t-\n\t - Overall this snapshot of adoption feels pretty neutral, and is being driven by losses to Facebook/Meta share price.\n\t\t- Deloitte have just [conducted a UKsurvey](https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/digital-consumer-trends-2022-metaverse.html).This covers “metaverse, virtual reality, and web3 (i.e. blockchain-basedassets like Bitcoin”, and so is perfect for our needs. They have similarresults to the bigger US survey. Their key finding are quoted belowverbatim:\n\t\t-\n\t - 63% of respondents have heard of the term “metaverse”. However, roughly half of those know nothing about it.\n\t\t-\n\t - Only 18% of VR headsets are used daily, from the 8% of individuals that claim to have access to one.\n\t\t-\n\t - Consumers may be wary of web 3. While most people (93%) have heard of cryptocurrency, only one in five (19%) know at least a “fair amount” about it. Knowledge of NFTs is rarer still.\n\t\t-\n\t - 70% of those who have heard of these assets say they are unlikely to buy them in the next, and cite fraud, scams and a lack of regulation as key concerns.\n\t- Deloitte feel that “content is key” for virtual reality to be a success,but we would instead argue that applications are key. Nearly half oftheir respondents were simply “not interested in VR”. We think thismatches our longstanding understanding of the reality of the market. Afew vocal proponents of the technology does not necessarily lead to adeveloped and mature mass appeal. Again, we feel that real world usecases will drive adoption over a longer time frame. Virtual meetings donot feel like that application to us.\n\t- They feel that ‘one metaverse’ would require blockchain/web3 tooling fora common consensus frame, and we agree with this. It seems like a verylong way to that point, and perhaps not worth the effort. They, like us,see compatible silos as being the interim step.\n\t- They (unusually) have a legal opinion in the text, and this is valuableenough to quote verbatim once again. it“The metaverse amplifies existinglegal issues and raises new ones. Centralised metaverses, such as thosefocused on games, tend to engage consumers in a controlled space andoperate within familiar legal frameworks. For example, users purchasinga virtual accessory are likely to understand its use will be withintightly prescribed parameters. Decentralised metaverses, whichincorporate web3 (such as NFTs) are more challenging, as users mayexpect virtual assets to be portable. However, those assets are governedby inconsistent and often unclear terms, and the lack of technicalstandards can result in limited interoperability between metaverses. Forthe user, social interactions in virtual worlds can feel realistic,inviting scrutiny from policymakers and regulators focused on onlinesafety. An increased legislative focus on children online will alsorequire platforms to assess or verify the age of users. And collectionof personal data – such as eye movement within a VR headset – willrequire informed consent under data protection laws, and a clearunderstanding of who is controlling that data at any given time.Finally, as content is key, clear contractual parameters are required toframe how intellectual property is used, whether user-generated contentis permitted, and how illegal/harmful content is managed. Amid all ofthis, metaverse builders, content owners and brands must ensure theyhave a risk assessment and risk management framework in place to avoidcostly mistakes, both reputational and financial, in an increasinglyregulated space.”\n\t- [The Drum](https://www.thedrum.com/about-us) is a market awarenesswebsite and[compiled](https://www.thedrum.com/news/2022/08/01/web3-the-numbers-key-metaverse-crypto-and-nft-stats-every-marketer-should-know)the following statistics, which have been linked back to their sourceand annotated for our needs. it\n\t\t-\n\t - 89.4 million Americans are expected to use virtual reality (VR) in 2022, [according to insiderintelligence](https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/us-augmented-virtual-reality-users-forecast-2022). That number, according to the same source, is expected to climb to 110.3 million in 2025. As a counter to this only around 16M VR headsets were sold in 2022\n\t\t-\n\t - 51% of gen Z and 48% of millennials envision doing some of their work in the metaverse in the next two years, according to Microsoft’s Work Trend Index 2022.\n\t\t-\n\t - 38% of respondents said they would “try extreme sports like skydiving, bungee jumping, or paragliding” in the metaverse according to a recent Statista survey called ‘What things would you do in the metaverse but never in real life?’ Unsettlingly, 18% of respondents said they would “conduct unethical experiments on virtual humans”\n\t\t-\n\t - 87% of Americans between the ages of 13-56 would be interested in engaging with a virtual experience in the metaverse “that is built around a celebrity they love,” according to new research from UTA and Vox Media\n\t\t-\n\t - $678bn is forecasted to be the total market valuation of the metaverse by 2030, per Grand View Research.

On the other hand, 54% say that their workplace using the metaverse would “not \\[be\\] important at all” in their decision to give the metaverse a try\n\t\t-\n\t - 15% of gen Zs’ “fun budget” is spent in the metaverse, per a report from Razorfish and Vice Media Group. In five years that number is projected to climb to 20%\n\t\t-\n\t - Nearly 77% believe that the metaverse “can cause serious harm to modern society,” per a recent survey from customer service platform Tidio. The survey, which received feedback from 1,000 participants, identified three major causes of anxiety related to the metaverse and its potentially negative social impacts: “addiction to a simulated reality” was the number one concern, followed by “privacy issues” and “mental health issues,” which were tied for second\n\t\t-\n\t - By 2026, about 2 billion people worldwide “will spend at least one hour a day in the metaverse to work, shop, attend school, socialize or consume entertainment,” per McCann Worldgroup. By that same year, the total value of the virtual goods market in the metaverse could be as high as $200bn\n\t\t-\n\t - NFTs Over $37bn has been spent in NFT marketplaces as of May 2022, per data from Chainalysis. At their current rate, this year’s NFT sales could potentially surpass last year’s, which had a total valuation of around $40bn, according to the data\n\t\t-\n\t - $91.8m was the sale price of ‘The Merge,’ the most valuable NFT to date. Created by the artist Pak, it sold for its record-breaking value in December 2021\n\t\t-\n\t - 64% of sports fans are open to the idea of learning more about NFTs and would consider purchasing one in the future, according to the National Research Group. The report also found that 46% of sports fans “would be more likely to attend live sporting events if they were rewarded with a commemorative NFT – for example, if their ticket turned into a digital collectible after the game”\n\t\t-\n\t - Only 9% of people aged 16-44 own a NFT, and less than half (44%) have purchased or invested in crypto, per a new survey from agency SCS. On the other hand, among the survey’s 600 respondents, 64% were “aware” of the metaverse, and 65% of that subgroup say they are “interested in exploring it further for everything from traveling to new places and playing games to making money and shopping”\n\t\t- Polling company IPSOS [haveconducted](https://www.ipsos.com/en/global-advisor-metaverse-extended-reality-may-2022)a global survey for the World Economic Forum. Some highlights are:\n\t\t-\n\t - “Excitement about extended reality is significantly higher in emerging countries than it is in most high-income countries. In China, India, Peru, Saudi Arabia, and Colombia, more than two-thirds say they have positive feelings about the possibility of engaging with it.”\n\t\t-\n\t - “Familiarity and favorability toward the new technologies are also significantly higher among younger adults, those with a higher level of education, and men than they are among older adults, those without a college-level education, and women.”\n\t- Excitingly for our exploration of the topic it can be seen in Figure<a href=\"#fig:applications\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"fig:applications\">[fig:applications]</a>that education within metaverse spaces is the most anticipatedapplication, and we have seen that the emerging globals markets are themost optimistic about the technology overall.

As a decentralised mapping platform, Yonder allows users to create, share, and interact with location-based data without relying on centralised services like Google Maps. It incorporates features such as geochat and encrypted location sharing, ensuring users retain full control over their data and interactions.\n\t- Yonder supports decentralised governance by allowing users to directly influence the map's content and structure without needing approval from a central authority. Disputes and verification issues are handled through decentralised mechanisms, such as proof-of-work or social trust systems, maintaining the platform's integrity while preserving its openness.\n\t\t- Decentralised Map Creation: Users contribute to the map without needing permission.\n\t\t- Geochat: Enables location-based communication within specific geographic areas.\n\t\t- Encrypted Location Sharing: Allows secure and private location sharing.\n\t\t- Social Trust and Verification: Leverages social trust mechanisms and potentially proof-of-work systems to ensure data accuracy and reliability.\n\t\t- Community Ownership: The map is collectively owned and maintained by the user community.\n\t\t- Decentralised Governance: Decisions regarding the platform's development and direction are made through decentralised consensus mechanisms.\n\t\t- Transparency and Accountability: All interactions and contributions are recorded on the Nostr network.\n\t\t- Resilience and Censorship Resistance: The decentralised nature of the platform provides resistance to censorship and single points of failure.\n\n- # DAO\n\t- Every project, every bot, can be a DAO\n\t- [UniSat](https://unisat.io/runes/market?tick=WORK%E2%80%A2IN%E2%80%A2PROGRESS)\n\t-\n-\n\n\t- ### Author Background: Sam Hammond\n\t\t- **Background:** Senior economist at the Foundation for American Innovation with previous tenures at the Niskanen Institute and Mercatus Center.

It's not for a privileged minority to dictate what constitutes \"worthwhile\" work and unilaterally reshape the employment landscape, removing options that many find fulfilling. The transition to an AI-driven future must be guided by \"[the art of the desirable,](https://tomcheesewright.com/the-art-of-the-probable-the-possible-and-the-desirable)\" fostering social consensus and prioritising individual choice, rather than imposing a singular vision of progress.\n\t\t- While some reports predict widespread displacement across various skill levels, others like David Autor's work suggest AI could empower workers and create new opportunities. However, even in optimistic scenarios, the *nature* of work will undoubtedly change. This shift necessitates a focus on transitions and training, ensuring that those who prefer repetitive roles aren't simply discarded but are provided with pathways to new forms of employment that align with their preferences and evolving skill sets.\n\t\t- The \"scorched earth\" tactics of major tech companies, prioritising profit through automation and workforce reduction, further complicate this transition. Their pursuit of the \"art of the possible\" within a for-profit model, as highlighted in our notes on Microsoft, Meta, and Google, risks exacerbating existing inequalities and leaving vulnerable workers behind. The lack of binding legislation, despite the Cambridge Analytica scandal and growing public backlash against AI, underscores the urgency of bottom-up movements like the screen writers guild strike to protect worker rights.\n\t\t- The \"art of the desirable\" framework demands that we consider the needs and desires of *all* workers, not just those who thrive in dynamic, creative environments. This means:\n\t\t\t- **Protecting choice:** Individuals should have the option to pursue roles that suit their preferences, whether those roles involve repetitive tasks or complex problem-solving. The \"worker of one\" concept championed by Autor should extend to encompass the diversity of human preferences and working styles.\n\t\t\t- **Investing in human-centred training:** Reskilling programmes should not solely focus on technical AI skills but should also cultivate essential human capabilities like communication, empathy, and critical thinking, which remain crucial even in an AI-driven world. This aligns with the re-evaluation of human capital discussed in our notes.\n\t\t\t- **Fostering social dialogue and consensus:** The future of work must be determined through open discussions involving workers, policymakers, and technologists. The \"art of the desirable\" requires a democratic approach, prioritising social consensus over top-down dictates from Silicon Valley.\n\t\t\t- **Prioritising well-being and fulfilment:** Beyond economic considerations, the new social contract must value the well-being and fulfilment of all workers. This includes ensuring fair wages, reasonable working hours, and access to resources that support mental and emotional health, especially for those navigating challenging transitions.\n\t\t-\n\n- # Misc\n- [twitter link to the render loading below](https://twitter.com/generalising/status/1772744143476842732)\n  {{twitter https://twitter.com/generalising/status/1772744143476842732}} -\n- [Generative AI Could Raise Global GDP by 7% (goldmansachs.com)](https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/generative-ai-could-raise-global-gdp-by-7-percent.html)\n- [Nobel Prize laureate Chris Pissarides on ChatGPT, AI and the four-day workweek | Fortune Europe](https://fortune.com/europe/2023/12/02/nobel-prize-economist-christopher-pissarides-chatgpt-workplace-automation-one-year-launch/)\n- [The Shorter Working Week: a report from Autonomy\n\t- Autonomy](https://autonomy.work/portfolio/the-shorter-working-week-a-report-from-autonomy-in-collaboration-with-members-of-the-4-day-week-campaign/)\n- [Ray Dalio says AI could create a 3-day workweek | Fortune](https://fortune.com/2023/09/18/ray-dalio-ai-3-day-work-week-investing-advice-portfolio-cash-bonds-tech-bridgewater-associates/)\n- [JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon: AI will lead to 3.5-day workweek | Fortune](https://fortune.com/2023/10/03/jamie-dimon-jpmorgan-chase-ceo-ai-impact-working-week/)\n- [IBM CEO: ‘Today’s workforce should prepare to work hand in hand with A.I.' | Fortune](https://fortune.com/2023/04/20/ibm-ceo-work-ai-artificial-intelligence-careers-tech-arvind-krishna/)\n- https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/blog/news/the-surprising-connection-between-after-hours-work-and-decreased-productivity\n- [CEO effect on firm performance mostly due to chance | ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/10/151022192337.htm)\n- [[Layoff tracker and threatened roles]]\n-\n\n\t- ### Hardware\n\t\t- **[Meta Quest 3S](https://www.linezero.com/blog/meta-connect-2024-new-headsets-ai-and-the-future-of-work)**: A more affordable mixed reality headset.\n\t\t- **[Orion](https://www.linezero.com/blog/meta-connect-2024-new-headsets-ai-and-the-future-of-work)**: Meta's first true augmented reality glasses.\n\n\t\t\t- ## Key Findings from earlier in the adoption\n\t\t\t\t- As of August 2024, 39.4% of Americans aged 18-64 reported using generative AI.\n\t\t\t\t- 28% of employed respondents said they use generative AI at work.\n\t\t\t\t- Nearly 1 in 9 workers (10.6%) reported using generative AI daily at work.\n\t\t\t\t- Adoption has been faster than previous transformative technologies like personal computers and the internet.\n\n\t\t\t\t- ### Adoption Across Industries\n\t\t\t\t\t- Generative AI usage spans a wide range of occupations:\n\t\t\t\t\t- Over 40% adoption in management, business, and computing professions.\n\t\t\t\t\t- 20% of \"blue-collar\" workers (e.g. construction, maintenance, transportation) use generative AI frequently at work.\n\n\t\t- #### **Bitcoin as the Trust and Settlement Layer**\n\t\t- The Bitcoin network, secured by its Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, serves as the immutable, decentralized anchor for the entire system.

Their reportis titled “[VR Usage & Consumer Attitudes, WaveVI](https://artilleryiq.com/reports/vr-usage-consumer-attitudes-wave-vi/)”.In the USA (which is the cohort they surveyed) they found that adoptionof VR headsets is slower than predicted (their work is longitudinal),but steady. Some highlight points are:\n\t\t-\n\t - 23 percent of U.S. adults own or ithave used VR technology. This is around 4% up from the previous survey in 2020. Frustratingly, and very much in keeping with such industry surveys they conflate ‘own’ with ’have used’ making this data pretty meaningless from an adoption point of view.\n\t\t-\n\t - there is a skew toward male users of around 10%, and a far larger skew toward younger users, and a bias toward richer households. These are indicative of a technology that’s still early in it’s adoption cycle.\n\t\t-\n\t - Of the owners of the technology (no indication what percentage this is) they found that around a third used the equipment regularly, but that this retention number was gently falling.\n\t\t-\n\t - Standalone headsets (Quest 2 and Pico 4) without a cabled connection to a computer are far more popular, and have better user retention. This makes sense as the alternative demands either space or setup time.\n\t\t-\n\t - Buyers of these more popular headsets are very sensitive to price. Note here that Meta is selling Quest2 at a loss to drive the market. This is unsustainable.\n\t\t-\n\t - Overall this snapshot of adoption feels pretty neutral, and is being driven by losses to Facebook/Meta share price.\n\t\t- Deloitte have just [conducted a UKsurvey](https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/digital-consumer-trends-2022-metaverse.html).This covers “metaverse, virtual reality, and web3 (i.e. blockchain-basedassets like Bitcoin”, and so is perfect for our needs. They have similarresults to the bigger US survey. Their key finding are quoted belowverbatim:\n\t\t-\n\t - 63% of respondents have heard of the term “metaverse”. However, roughly half of those know nothing about it.\n\t\t-\n\t - Only 18% of VR headsets are used daily, from the 8% of individuals that claim to have access to one.\n\t\t-\n\t - Consumers may be wary of web 3. While most people (93%) have heard of cryptocurrency, only one in five (19%) know at least a “fair amount” about it. Knowledge of NFTs is rarer still.\n\t\t-\n\t - 70% of those who have heard of these assets say they are unlikely to buy them in the next, and cite fraud, scams and a lack of regulation as key concerns.\n\t- Deloitte feel that “content is key” for virtual reality to be a success,but we would instead argue that applications are key. Nearly half oftheir respondents were simply “not interested in VR”. We think thismatches our longstanding understanding of the reality of the market. Afew vocal proponents of the technology does not necessarily lead to adeveloped and mature mass appeal. Again, we feel that real world usecases will drive adoption over a longer time frame. Virtual meetings donot feel like that application to us.\n\t- They feel that ‘one metaverse’ would require blockchain/web3 tooling fora common consensus frame, and we agree with this. It seems like a verylong way to that point, and perhaps not worth the effort. They, like us,see compatible silos as being the interim step.\n\t- They (unusually) have a legal opinion in the text, and this is valuableenough to quote verbatim once again. it“The metaverse amplifies existinglegal issues and raises new ones. Centralised metaverses, such as thosefocused on games, tend to engage consumers in a controlled space andoperate within familiar legal frameworks. For example, users purchasinga virtual accessory are likely to understand its use will be withintightly prescribed parameters. Decentralised metaverses, whichincorporate web3 (such as NFTs) are more challenging, as users mayexpect virtual assets to be portable. However, those assets are governedby inconsistent and often unclear terms, and the lack of technicalstandards can result in limited interoperability between metaverses. Forthe user, social interactions in virtual worlds can feel realistic,inviting scrutiny from policymakers and regulators focused on onlinesafety. An increased legislative focus on children online will alsorequire platforms to assess or verify the age of users. And collectionof personal data – such as eye movement within a VR headset – willrequire informed consent under data protection laws, and a clearunderstanding of who is controlling that data at any given time.Finally, as content is key, clear contractual parameters are required toframe how intellectual property is used, whether user-generated contentis permitted, and how illegal/harmful content is managed. Amid all ofthis, metaverse builders, content owners and brands must ensure theyhave a risk assessment and risk management framework in place to avoidcostly mistakes, both reputational and financial, in an increasinglyregulated space.”\n\t- [The Drum](https://www.thedrum.com/about-us) is a market awarenesswebsite and[compiled](https://www.thedrum.com/news/2022/08/01/web3-the-numbers-key-metaverse-crypto-and-nft-stats-every-marketer-should-know)the following statistics, which have been linked back to their sourceand annotated for our needs. it\n\t\t-\n\t - 89.4 million Americans are expected to use virtual reality (VR) in 2022, [according to insiderintelligence](https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/us-augmented-virtual-reality-users-forecast-2022). That number, according to the same source, is expected to climb to 110.3 million in 2025. As a counter to this only around 16M VR headsets were sold in 2022\n\t\t-\n\t - 51% of gen Z and 48% of millennials envision doing some of their work in the metaverse in the next two years, according to Microsoft’s Work Trend Index 2022.\n\t\t-\n\t - 38% of respondents said they would “try extreme sports like skydiving, bungee jumping, or paragliding” in the metaverse according to a recent Statista survey called ‘What things would you do in the metaverse but never in real life?’ Unsettlingly, 18% of respondents said they would “conduct unethical experiments on virtual humans”\n\t\t-\n\t - 87% of Americans between the ages of 13-56 would be interested in engaging with a virtual experience in the metaverse “that is built around a celebrity they love,” according to new research from UTA and Vox Media\n\t\t-\n\t - $678bn is forecasted to be the total market valuation of the metaverse by 2030, per Grand View Research.

On the other hand, 54% say that their workplace using the metaverse would “not \\[be\\] important at all” in their decision to give the metaverse a try\n\t\t-\n\t - 15% of gen Zs’ “fun budget” is spent in the metaverse, per a report from Razorfish and Vice Media Group. In five years that number is projected to climb to 20%\n\t\t-\n\t - Nearly 77% believe that the metaverse “can cause serious harm to modern society,” per a recent survey from customer service platform Tidio. The survey, which received feedback from 1,000 participants, identified three major causes of anxiety related to the metaverse and its potentially negative social impacts: “addiction to a simulated reality” was the number one concern, followed by “privacy issues” and “mental health issues,” which were tied for second\n\t\t-\n\t - By 2026, about 2 billion people worldwide “will spend at least one hour a day in the metaverse to work, shop, attend school, socialize or consume entertainment,” per McCann Worldgroup. By that same year, the total value of the virtual goods market in the metaverse could be as high as $200bn\n\t\t-\n\t - NFTs Over $37bn has been spent in NFT marketplaces as of May 2022, per data from Chainalysis. At their current rate, this year’s NFT sales could potentially surpass last year’s, which had a total valuation of around $40bn, according to the data\n\t\t-\n\t - $91.8m was the sale price of ‘The Merge,’ the most valuable NFT to date. Created by the artist Pak, it sold for its record-breaking value in December 2021\n\t\t-\n\t - 64% of sports fans are open to the idea of learning more about NFTs and would consider purchasing one in the future, according to the National Research Group. The report also found that 46% of sports fans “would be more likely to attend live sporting events if they were rewarded with a commemorative NFT – for example, if their ticket turned into a digital collectible after the game”\n\t\t-\n\t - Only 9% of people aged 16-44 own a NFT, and less than half (44%) have purchased or invested in crypto, per a new survey from agency SCS. On the other hand, among the survey’s 600 respondents, 64% were “aware” of the metaverse, and 65% of that subgroup say they are “interested in exploring it further for everything from traveling to new places and playing games to making money and shopping”\n\t\t- Polling company IPSOS [haveconducted](https://www.ipsos.com/en/global-advisor-metaverse-extended-reality-may-2022)a global survey for the World Economic Forum. Some highlights are:\n\t\t-\n\t - “Excitement about extended reality is significantly higher in emerging countries than it is in most high-income countries. In China, India, Peru, Saudi Arabia, and Colombia, more than two-thirds say they have positive feelings about the possibility of engaging with it.”\n\t\t-\n\t - “Familiarity and favorability toward the new technologies are also significantly higher among younger adults, those with a higher level of education, and men than they are among older adults, those without a college-level education, and women.”\n\t- Excitingly for our exploration of the topic it can be seen in Figure<a href=\"#fig:applications\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"fig:applications\">[fig:applications]</a>that education within metaverse spaces is the most anticipatedapplication, and we have seen that the emerging globals markets are themost optimistic about the technology overall.

As a decentralised mapping platform, Yonder allows users to create, share, and interact with location-based data without relying on centralised services like Google Maps. It incorporates features such as geochat and encrypted location sharing, ensuring users retain full control over their data and interactions.\n\t- Yonder supports decentralised governance by allowing users to directly influence the map's content and structure without needing approval from a central authority. Disputes and verification issues are handled through decentralised mechanisms, such as proof-of-work or social trust systems, maintaining the platform's integrity while preserving its openness.\n\t\t- Decentralised Map Creation: Users contribute to the map without needing permission.\n\t\t- Geochat: Enables location-based communication within specific geographic areas.\n\t\t- Encrypted Location Sharing: Allows secure and private location sharing.\n\t\t- Social Trust and Verification: Leverages social trust mechanisms and potentially proof-of-work systems to ensure data accuracy and reliability.\n\t\t- Community Ownership: The map is collectively owned and maintained by the user community.\n\t\t- Decentralised Governance: Decisions regarding the platform's development and direction are made through decentralised consensus mechanisms.\n\t\t- Transparency and Accountability: All interactions and contributions are recorded on the Nostr network.\n\t\t- Resilience and Censorship Resistance: The decentralised nature of the platform provides resistance to censorship and single points of failure.\n\n- # DAO\n\t- Every project, every bot, can be a DAO\n\t- [UniSat](https://unisat.io/runes/market?tick=WORK%E2%80%A2IN%E2%80%A2PROGRESS)\n\t-\n-\n\n\t- ### Author Background: Sam Hammond\n\t\t- **Background:** Senior economist at the Foundation for American Innovation with previous tenures at the Niskanen Institute and Mercatus Center.

It's not for a privileged minority to dictate what constitutes \"worthwhile\" work and unilaterally reshape the employment landscape, removing options that many find fulfilling. The transition to an AI-driven future must be guided by \"[the art of the desirable,](https://tomcheesewright.com/the-art-of-the-probable-the-possible-and-the-desirable)\" fostering social consensus and prioritising individual choice, rather than imposing a singular vision of progress.\n\t\t- While some reports predict widespread displacement across various skill levels, others like David Autor's work suggest AI could empower workers and create new opportunities. However, even in optimistic scenarios, the *nature* of work will undoubtedly change. This shift necessitates a focus on transitions and training, ensuring that those who prefer repetitive roles aren't simply discarded but are provided with pathways to new forms of employment that align with their preferences and evolving skill sets.\n\t\t- The \"scorched earth\" tactics of major tech companies, prioritising profit through automation and workforce reduction, further complicate this transition. Their pursuit of the \"art of the possible\" within a for-profit model, as highlighted in our notes on Microsoft, Meta, and Google, risks exacerbating existing inequalities and leaving vulnerable workers behind. The lack of binding legislation, despite the Cambridge Analytica scandal and growing public backlash against AI, underscores the urgency of bottom-up movements like the screen writers guild strike to protect worker rights.\n\t\t- The \"art of the desirable\" framework demands that we consider the needs and desires of *all* workers, not just those who thrive in dynamic, creative environments. This means:\n\t\t\t- **Protecting choice:** Individuals should have the option to pursue roles that suit their preferences, whether those roles involve repetitive tasks or complex problem-solving. The \"worker of one\" concept championed by Autor should extend to encompass the diversity of human preferences and working styles.\n\t\t\t- **Investing in human-centred training:** Reskilling programmes should not solely focus on technical AI skills but should also cultivate essential human capabilities like communication, empathy, and critical thinking, which remain crucial even in an AI-driven world. This aligns with the re-evaluation of human capital discussed in our notes.\n\t\t\t- **Fostering social dialogue and consensus:** The future of work must be determined through open discussions involving workers, policymakers, and technologists. The \"art of the desirable\" requires a democratic approach, prioritising social consensus over top-down dictates from Silicon Valley.\n\t\t\t- **Prioritising well-being and fulfilment:** Beyond economic considerations, the new social contract must value the well-being and fulfilment of all workers. This includes ensuring fair wages, reasonable working hours, and access to resources that support mental and emotional health, especially for those navigating challenging transitions.\n\t\t-\n\n- # Misc\n- [twitter link to the render loading below](https://twitter.com/generalising/status/1772744143476842732)\n  {{twitter https://twitter.com/generalising/status/1772744143476842732}} -\n- [Generative AI Could Raise Global GDP by 7% (goldmansachs.com)](https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/generative-ai-could-raise-global-gdp-by-7-percent.html)\n- [Nobel Prize laureate Chris Pissarides on ChatGPT, AI and the four-day workweek | Fortune Europe](https://fortune.com/europe/2023/12/02/nobel-prize-economist-christopher-pissarides-chatgpt-workplace-automation-one-year-launch/)\n- [The Shorter Working Week: a report from Autonomy\n\t- Autonomy](https://autonomy.work/portfolio/the-shorter-working-week-a-report-from-autonomy-in-collaboration-with-members-of-the-4-day-week-campaign/)\n- [Ray Dalio says AI could create a 3-day workweek | Fortune](https://fortune.com/2023/09/18/ray-dalio-ai-3-day-work-week-investing-advice-portfolio-cash-bonds-tech-bridgewater-associates/)\n- [JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon: AI will lead to 3.5-day workweek | Fortune](https://fortune.com/2023/10/03/jamie-dimon-jpmorgan-chase-ceo-ai-impact-working-week/)\n- [IBM CEO: ‘Today’s workforce should prepare to work hand in hand with A.I.' | Fortune](https://fortune.com/2023/04/20/ibm-ceo-work-ai-artificial-intelligence-careers-tech-arvind-krishna/)\n- https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/blog/news/the-surprising-connection-between-after-hours-work-and-decreased-productivity\n- [CEO effect on firm performance mostly due to chance | ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/10/151022192337.htm)\n- [[Layoff tracker and threatened roles]]\n-\n\n\t\t- #### **Bitcoin as the Trust and Settlement Layer**\n\t\t- The Bitcoin network, secured by its Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, serves as the immutable, decentralized anchor for the entire system.

In addition (in the current implementation) an identity proof does not need to be published to be valid, just timestamped. In this way an identity can be stolen and used years later to claim later chains of proof.
