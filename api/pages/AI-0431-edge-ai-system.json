These systems process data in real-time at the source, reducing latency to milliseconds while minimizing bandwidth consumption and cloud dependency. Edge AI Systems optimize for resource-constrained environments with limited memory (typically 128KB-512MB), power budgets (10-100mW), and computational capacity compared to data centers. They incorporate model compression techniques including quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation to fit neural networks into embedded hardware. Core characteristics include deterministic latency guarantees, offline-capable operation, privacy preservation through local processing, and direct sensor-to-actuator decision loops. Edge AI Systems span diverse deployment scenarios: industrial IoT monitoring for predictive maintenance, autonomous vehicle perception pipelines, smart home voice processing, medical wearables, drone navigation, and surveillance analytics. The architecture balances accuracy against resource constraints through adaptive model selection, hierarchical processing, and strategic cloud-edge collaboration for complex inference tasks. Standards like IEEE P2956 and IEC 63296 provide architectural frameworks. Edge AI Systems represent the convergence of embedded systems, machine learning, and real-time computing, enabling intelligent autonomous operations across distributed networks with minimal human intervention.\n    - maturity:: mature\n    - source:: \n    - authority-score:: 0.95\n\n  - **Semantic Classification**\n    - owl:class:: aigo:EdgeAISystem\n    - owl:physicality:: VirtualEntity\n    - owl:role:: Process\n    - owl:inferred-class:: aigo:VirtualProcess\n    - belongsToDomain:: [[AIEthicsDomain]]\n    - implementedInLayer:: [[ConceptualLayer]]\n\n  - #### Relationships\n    id:: edge-ai-system-(ai-0431)-relationships\n\n  - #### OWL Axioms\n    id:: edge-ai-system-(ai-0431)-owl-axioms\n    collapsed:: true\n    - ```clojure\n      (Declaration (Class :EdgeAISystem))\n(AnnotationAssertion rdfs:label :EdgeAISystem \"Edge AI System\"@en)\n(SubClassOf :EdgeAISystem :AIGovernancePrinciple)\n\n;; Deployment Characteristics\n(SubClassOf :EdgeAISystem\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :deployedOn :EdgeDevice))\n(SubClassOf :EdgeAISystem\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :optimizedFor :LowLatency))\n(SubClassOf :EdgeAISystem\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :constrainedBy :ResourceLimitations))\n\n;; Processing Location\n(SubClassOf :EdgeAISystem\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :performsInference :LocallyOnDevice))\n(SubClassOf :EdgeAISystem\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :minimises :CloudDependency))\n\n;; Resource Constraints\n(DataPropertyAssertion :hasMaxMemoryKB :EdgeAISystem \"512\"^^xsd:integer)\n(DataPropertyAssertion :hasMaxPowerMW :EdgeAISystem \"100\"^^xsd:integer)\n(DataPropertyAssertion :hasMaxLatencyMS :EdgeAISystem \"10\"^^xsd:integer)\n(DataPropertyAssertion :hasMinInferenceHz :EdgeAISystem \"10\"^^xsd:integer)\n\n;; Architecture Properties\n(SubClassOf :EdgeAISystem\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :implements :ModelCompression))\n(SubClassOf :EdgeAISystem\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :supports :OfflineInference))\n\n;; Standards Compliance\n(AnnotationAssertion rdfs:seeAlso :EdgeAISystem\n  \"IEEE P2956 - Standard for Edge Intelligence\")\n(AnnotationAssertion rdfs:seeAlso :EdgeAISystem\n  \"IEC 63296 - Edge Intelligence Architecture\")\n      ```\n\n### Relationships\n- is-subclass-of:: [[AIApplications]]",
