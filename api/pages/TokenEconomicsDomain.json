Token economics, or \"tokenomics,\" represents the fusion of mechanism design, game theory, monetary economics, and distributed systems, creating self-regulating economic systems without central monetary authorities. This domain emerged from Bitcoin's innovative solution to the double-spending problem through economic incentives (block rewards encouraging miners to secure the network) and has expanded dramatically with smart contract platforms enabling sophisticated economic mechanisms, DeFi protocols creating new financial primitives, and NFTs establishing digital scarcity and ownership. Token economics is not merely an implementation detail but a fundamental component of blockchain security: in many blockchain systems, economic security (cost to attack exceeds benefit) provides stronger guarantees than cryptographic security alone.\n\n    - The domain encompasses several interconnected economic frameworks. **Token design and standards** establish the technical and functional properties of blockchain-native digital assets. Token standards like ERC-20 (fungible tokens), ERC-721 (non-fungible tokens), and ERC-1155 (multi-token standard) define interfaces enabling interoperability and composability across applications. Tokens can represent diverse assets and rights: cryptocurrencies as mediums of exchange and stores of value, utility tokens providing access to services, governance tokens granting decision-making power, security tokens representing equity or debt, stablecoins maintaining price stability through various mechanisms (fiat-collateralized, crypto-collateralized, algorithmic), and non-fungible tokens establishing unique digital ownership. Token design involves critical decisions around supply models (fixed supply like Bitcoin, inflationary like Ethereum, dynamic based on demand), distribution mechanisms (mining, airdrops, initial coin offerings, fair launches), and monetary policy (emission schedules, burning mechanisms, fee structures).\n\n    - **Incentive mechanism design** addresses how blockchain systems align individual participant incentives with network goals. Miners or validators must be incentivized to act honestly (producing valid blocks, including valid transactions) rather than attempting to cheat (double-spending, censoring transactions, attacking consensus). This incentive alignment is achieved through rewards (block rewards, transaction fees, MEV) for honest behavior and penalties (slashing, orphaned blocks, opportunity costs) for misbehavior. Transaction fee markets allocate scarce block space efficiently: when demand exceeds supply, fees rise, prioritizing transactions by willingness to pay. Gas mechanisms (Ethereum's unit of computational work) price smart contract execution, preventing denial-of-service attacks while enabling complex computations. Staking rewards compensate validators for capital lockup and operational costs while providing economic security (accumulated stake creates cost to attack). The design of these incentive mechanisms requires careful game-theoretic analysis: are there profitable attack strategies, do incentives remain aligned as network conditions change, does the system reach stable equilibria?\n\n    - **Decentralized Finance (DeFi) economics** represents a major expansion of token economics beyond securing base-layer blockchains to creating sophisticated financial primitives. Automated Market Makers (AMMs) enable decentralized token exchange through mathematical formulas (constant product, constant sum, hybrid curves) rather than order books, with liquidity providers earning fees for depositing token pairs. Lending protocols enable overcollateralized and undercollateralized lending through interest rate models, liquidation mechanisms, and risk assessment. Yield farming incentivizes liquidity provision through additional token rewards, though often creating unsustainable APYs and mercenary capital. Stablecoins attempt to maintain price stability through various mechanisms: fiat-collateralized stablecoins backed by bank reserves (USDC, USDT), crypto-collateralized stablecoins backed by overcollateralized cryptocurrency (DAI), and algorithmic stablecoins using protocol mechanisms to maintain peg (with varied success). These DeFi primitives compose to create complex financial systems with novel risks including smart contract vulnerabilities, economic attack vectors (flash loan attacks, oracle manipulation), and systemic risk from composability (one protocol's failure cascading to others).\n\n    - ### Scope and Boundaries\n      - **Included:** All economic mechanisms, incentive structures, token systems, monetary models, and game-theoretic considerations within blockchain and distributed ledger systems, including cryptocurrency design, token standards, tokenomics, incentive alignment, economic security, DeFi primitives, NFT economics, governance mechanisms, and economic attack analysis.\n\n      - **Excluded:** General economic theory without blockchain application, traditional financial systems, fiat monetary policy, general game theory not applied to blockchain, microeconomic or macroeconomic principles unless specifically relevant to blockchain token systems, and behavioral economics unless addressing blockchain participant behavior.\n\n      - **Boundary Clarifications:** Concepts must relate to economic mechanisms or incentive structures within blockchain systems. Token standards belong here as they define economic assets. Gas fees belong here as they represent economic resource allocation mechanisms. Block rewards and staking yields belong here as incentive mechanisms. Economic security models (cost of attack, security budgets) belong here. However, the technical implementation of these mechanisms (e.g., the code implementing ERC-20 transfer functions) may belong more appropriately to technical domains, while TokenEconomicsDomain focuses on the economic properties and implications.\n\n    - ### Relationship to Other Classifications\n      - **Parent Domain - BlockchainDomain:** TokenEconomicsDomain is a specialized sub-domain of BlockchainDomain, focusing specifically on economic mechanisms while the parent domain encompasses the full breadth of blockchain technology including cryptography, consensus, networking, smart contracts, and applications. This hierarchical relationship recognizes that token economics is a critical but not sole component of blockchain systems.\n\n      - **Peer Sub-Domains:** TokenEconomicsDomain shares BlockchainDomain with CryptographicDomain and ConsensusDomain, and these domains are deeply interconnected. Economic incentives secure consensus mechanisms (block rewards incentivize mining, staking yields incentivize validation), consensus mechanisms distribute economic rewards (PoW mining rewards, PoS staking yields), and cryptographic mechanisms enable secure token transfers and ownership. For example, \"Staking\" spans both ConsensusDomain (staking secures PoS consensus) and TokenEconomicsDomain (staking involves economic incentives and capital allocation). This interconnection reflects the holistic design of blockchain systems where cryptography, consensus, and economics must align.\n\n      - **Layer Relationships:** TokenEconomicsDomain concepts are typically implemented in EconomicLayer (economic mechanisms and incentive structures) or ConceptualLayer (abstract economic models and token designs). Some concepts may also involve ProtocolLayer when economic mechanisms are protocol-specified (e.g., Bitcoin's halving schedule, Ethereum's EIP-1559 fee burning). This multi-layer implementation reflects that token economics spans from abstract economic theory through protocol specifications to practical economic mechanisms.\n\n    - ### Design Rationale\n      - **Economics as Security:** TokenEconomicsDomain is organized as a distinct sub-domain because economic security is fundamental to blockchain systems, often providing stronger security guarantees than cryptographic or consensus mechanisms alone. Bitcoin's security ultimately depends on the cost to acquire 51% hashpower exceeding the benefit of double-spending, an economic rather than cryptographic property. This fundamental role justifies dedicated domain classification.\n\n      - **Interdisciplinary Nature:** Token economics bridges computer science, cryptography, economics, game theory, and financial engineering. The domain structure accommodates this interdisciplinary nature by including both technical token specifications (standards, protocols) and economic analysis (incentive compatibility, game-theoretic equilibria, security budgets). This breadth serves blockchain practitioners who must understand both technical implementation and economic implications.\n\n      - **DeFi as Economic Innovation:** The domain gives significant attention to DeFi economic mechanisms because DeFi represents a major expansion of blockchain token economics beyond securing base layers to creating novel financial primitives. AMMs, lending protocols, yield farming, and stablecoin mechanisms represent economic innovations enabled by smart contracts and composable protocols, justifying dedicated coverage within the domain.\n\n      - **Practical Design Focus:** While the domain includes theoretical economic concepts (game-theoretic equilibria, mechanism design principles), it emphasizes practical tokenomics design decisions that blockchain projects must make: supply schedules, distribution mechanisms, fee structures, incentive alignment, and governance mechanisms. This practical focus serves blockchain founders, token designers, and protocol economists creating real systems.\n\n      - **Evolution and Sustainability:** The domain structure accommodates both established token economic models (Bitcoin's fixed supply and halving schedule, Ethereum's gas mechanism) and emerging innovations (novel DeFi primitives, NFT economic models, dynamic token supply mechanisms). As blockchain economic research advances and new token models emerge, the domain can incorporate these innovations while maintaining organizational coherence. Particular attention is paid to long-term sustainability questions: what happens to network security as block rewards decline, how do fee markets evolve with adoption, what token models prove sustainable versus speculative?\n\n## Academic Context\n\n- Token economics represents the intersection of mechanism design, game theory, monetary economics, and distributed systems engineering\n  -

    "- definition": "The TokenEconomicsDomain represents a specialized sub-domain within blockchain technology that encompasses economic mechanisms, incentive structures, token systems, and monetary models that govern blockchain ecosystems. This domain includes cryptocurrency design and properties, token standards and specifications (ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155), tokenomics models (supply schedules, inflation, burning mechanisms, vesting), incentive alignment mechanisms (staking rewards, transaction fees, block rewards, penalty mechanisms), economic security models (cost of attack, validator economics, fee markets), decentralized finance (DeFi) economic primitives (automated market makers, lending protocols, yield farming), non-fungible token (NFT) economics, governance token mechanisms, utility token design, and economic game theory as applied to blockchain systems. Token economics bridges computer science, cryptography, and economic theory, applying mechanism design, game theory, and monetary economics to create self-sustaining decentralized systems. The domain addresses critical challenges including aligning participant incentives with network security and health, designing sustainable token supply models, creating efficient markets for scarce blockchain resources (transaction inclusion, data storage, computation), preventing economic attacks, and ensuring long-term network viability as block rewards decline or change.",
