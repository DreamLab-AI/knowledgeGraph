Autonomous vehicles integrate sensor fusion, computer vision, deep learning, and control algorithms to achieve SAE automation levels ranging from Level 1 (driver assistance) to Level 5 (full automation).\n\n\n\n## Academic Context\n\n- Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are defined as vehicles capable of navigating and operating without human intervention, utilising artificial intelligence (AI) for perception, localisation, path planning, motion control, and decision-making.\n  - The academic foundation of AVs lies in robotics, computer vision, sensor fusion, machine learning, and control theory.\n  - Key developments include the integration of end-to-end AI models that combine perception, prediction, and planning into unified neural networks, improving adaptability to complex real-world driving scenarios.\n  - Research has increasingly focused on synthetic data generation via generative AI to train AV systems on diverse and rare driving conditions, enhancing safety and robustness.\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption of AVs remains progressive but cautious, with SAE automation levels ranging from Level 1 (driver assistance) to Level 5 (full automation) still under active development and testing.\n  - Notable organisations include Waymo, Tesla, Aurora, and various automotive manufacturers advancing AV technologies.\n  - Connected vehicle technology has become widespread, with approximately 75% of new vehicles equipped with connectivity features enabling vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication.\n  - Technical capabilities now include advanced sensor fusion, deep learning for perception, and AI-driven decision-making; however, limitations persist in handling complex urban environments and unpredictable scenarios.\n  - Regulatory frameworks are evolving, with agencies such as the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) prioritising safety, innovation, and commercial deployment, including augmented reality testing methods for AV performance.\n  - Standards and frameworks continue to develop globally, emphasising safety, interoperability, and cybersecurity.\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers and sources:\n  - Bojarski, M., et al.
