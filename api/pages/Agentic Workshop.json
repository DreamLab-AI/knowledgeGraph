You're not putting sheep in a pen one by one any more. sometimes the best path to getting the sheep in en masse is a long arc round the field where the agent develops the mass as it goes. Sometimes it's a structured play with more work up front. This somewhat depends on you.\n-\n- My background, why you're here, what you can expect\n- course structure (multi session, not completely interdependent, simple pricing)\n- background and rationalle\n\t- chatbots and the agent / agentic boundary are confusing\n\t\t- you probably already use them (deep research)\n\t\t\t- compare gemini pro deep research with [roo](https://gist.github.com/ruvnet/88c61ee4e38191b0be65f498792d5017) (first view of it)\n\t\t- why this complex way\n\t\t\t- talking about memory\n\t\t\t- consistency, flexibility, scale\n\t\t\t- data safety and privacy\n\t\t\t- longer run times, more thinking, as much as you need\n\t\t\t- price / performance\n\t\t\t- power use and the start of vibe coding\n- phased approach\n\t- Phase one (today)\n\t\t- introduction to vscode\n\t\t- introduction to roo code\n\t\t- context management and context engineering\n\t\t- demonstrate agents, see where we're going (visionflow)\n\t\t- show setup of the system (link to online homework)\n\t\t\t- show how to find all this guidance\n\t\t\t- gemini (free) (more like agents)\n\t\t- claude code (paid) (more like agentic)\n\t\t- case studies using agentic claude\n\t\t\t- -Project management (120 kids doing their own thing)\n\t\t\t- -Data visualisation (new python tools)\n\t\t\t- -Academic research and verifying sources.
