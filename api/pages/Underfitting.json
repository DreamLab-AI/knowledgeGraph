Springer. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-7138-7\n\n- Ongoing research directions\n\t- Research continues into automated methods for detecting and correcting underfitting, including meta-learning and adaptive model selection\n\t- There is growing interest in the intersection of underfitting and fairness, as overly simplistic models may fail to capture important subgroup patterns\n\n## UK Context\n\n- British contributions and implementations\n\t- UK researchers have made significant contributions to the theory and practice of model fitting, with notable work from institutions such as the Alan Turing Institute and the University of Oxford\n\t- British companies and public sector organisations increasingly adopt rigorous model evaluation practices to ensure robustness and fairness\n\n- North England innovation hubs\n\t- The Manchester AI Foundry and the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics are leading centres for applied machine learning research, with a focus on practical solutions to underfitting and other model fitting challenges\n\t- Regional case studies include the use of machine learning in healthcare and urban planning, where underfitting can have significant real-world consequences\n\n- Regional case studies\n\t- In Manchester, machine learning models for predicting air quality have been refined to avoid underfitting by incorporating a wide range of environmental and demographic features\n\t- In Leeds, models for traffic flow prediction have been improved through feature engineering and ensemble methods, reducing the risk of underfitting\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends and developments\n\t- The integration of domain knowledge into machine learning models is expected to further reduce the incidence of underfitting\n\t- Advances in explainable AI and model interpretability will enhance the ability to diagnose and correct underfitting\n\n- Anticipated challenges\n\t- As datasets become larger and more complex, the challenge of avoiding underfitting while maintaining model interpretability will persist\n\t- Ensuring that models are robust to changes in data distribution and context will remain a key challenge\n\n- Research priorities\n\t- Research priorities include developing more automated and adaptive methods for detecting and correcting underfitting, as well as exploring the intersection of underfitting and fairness in machine learning\n\n## References\n\n1.
