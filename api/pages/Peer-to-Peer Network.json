These technologies enable the transfer of portable 'goods' across digital society and promote the development and adoption of open protocols and data formats. The Nostr protocol, in particular, can link and federate mixed reality spaces, providing identity assurances and mediating data synchronization while maintaining reasonably strong cryptography. This also allows integration with the legacy web through ubiquitous web sockets. Bitcoin and associated technologies, despite their issues, have the potential to revolutionize the way digital society operates by enabling \"money-like networks\" which are a cornerstone of human interaction. Representations of traditional currencies can ride securely on top of these networks as stablecoins, opening up global collaborative working practices, especially for emerging markets.

[[Haber 1990]] Prior to Bitcoin, these structures were called ‘timechains.’ [[Nakamoto 2018]] It can be considered a triple-entry bookkeeping system, [[Ijiri 1986; Faccia 2019]] the first of its kind, integrating a ‘provable’ timestamp with a transaction ledger, solving the “double spend problem.” [[Chohan 2021; Perez 2019; Grunspan 2018]] Some see this as the first major innovation in ledger technology since double entry was codified in Venice in fourteen seventy-five. [[Sangster 2015]]\n\t- It was created pseudonymously by an [individual](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6bUyu2izFznSqdb6bbGLr0) calling themselves ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ in 2009, as a direct response to the perceived mishandling of the 2008 global financial crisis, [[nakamoto2018]] with the stated aim of challenging the status quo, with an [uncensorable](https://world.hey.com/dhh/i-was-wrong-we-need-crypto-587ccb03) technology, to create money which could not be [debased by inflation policy](http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source), and outside of the [politically captured](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/05/04/matt-taibbi-paypals-deplatforming-and-the-case-for-crypto/) fintech incumbents. It’s interesting to note that the narrative around the use case for Bitcoin has [shifted over its lifetime](https://uncommoncore.co/visions-of-bitcoin-how-major-bitcoin-narratives-changed-over-time/).\n\t- It remains persistently associated with the political trope of freedom, Libertarians, and the [[cypherpunk]] movement that spawned it, as seen in this monologue from avowed libertarian Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht (freed by President Trump in 2025 after lobbying from the Bitcoin industry).\n\t- {{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHMVyr5NjEY}}\n\t- The [“genesis block”](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block) which was hard-coded at the beginning of the ‘chain’ contains text from The Times newspaper detailing the second bank bailout.\n\t- There will only ever be ([just short of](https://blog.amberdata.io/why-the-bitcoin-supply-will-never-reach-21-million)) 21 million bitcoins issued, of which around 19.7 million have already been minted, and around 4 million lost forever. This ‘hard money’ absolute scarcity is a strong component of the Bitcoin meme landscape. These are basically arbitrary figures though; a combination of the issuance schedule, and an [‘educated guess’](https://plan99.net/~mike/satoshi-emails/thread1.html) by Nakamoto:[[nakamoto2018]]\n\t\t- *”My choice for the number of coins and distribution schedule was an educated guess. It was a difficult choice, because once the network is going it’s locked in and we’re stuck with it. I wanted to pick something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but without knowing the future, that’s very hard. I ended up picking something in the middle. If Bitcoin remains a small niche, it’ll be worth less per unit than existing currencies. If you imagine it being used for some fraction of world commerce, then there’s only going to be 21 million coins for the whole world, so it would be worth much more per unit.”*\n\t- Digital scarcity is incredibly important and is explained well by software engineer Hillibrand in a podcast (this text is paraphrased): “Digital scarcity is an interesting concept that was well explained by German economist Guido Hülsmann in his book “The Ethics of Money Production,” [[hulsmann2008ethics]] published in 2007. Hülsmann stated that an economic good that is defined entirely in terms of bits and bytes is unlikely ever to be produced spontaneously on a free market, and at the time, he was right. However, the emergence of Bitcoin would soon prove that digital scarcity could indeed be achieved. Hülsmann noted that an economic good must be scarce and rivalrous, meaning there is a potential for conflict over who can utilize the resource. For example, air is abundant but still considered scarce as its availability can be limited in specific situations, leading to conflicts over its use. The concept of digital scarcity is built on the idea that information, which is fundamentally not scarce, can be made scarce through specific mechanisms. Bitcoin, for instance, addresses the double-spending problem, where a digital token could be spent more than once, by establishing a decentralized network that prevents the same coin from being used in multiple transactions. Nakamoto devised a system that allows users to establish scarcity and rivalrousness in cyberspace without relying on a single trusted third party. Instead of relying on a central authority, like a government, to determine the validity of transactions, Bitcoin relies on a network of computers known as “full nodes” that verify and enforce a set of rules. This decentralized system enables the creation of digital goods that are both scarce and rivalrous, which was previously thought to be impossible.”\n\t- In theory, there is no [barrier to access](https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterizzo/2021/09/29/against-cryptocurrency-the-ethical-argument-for-bitcoin-maximalism/?), and [equality of opportunity](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/02/16/why-bitcoin-is-a-tool-for-social-justice/) to accumulate and save over long periods. This is not true of chains and tokens, which lock up some of their value for seed investors to cash out later. None of the blockchains since are decentralized in the same way.[[selvam2021blockchain]] Bitcoin was probably a [singular event](https://danhedl.medium.com/bitcoins-distribution-was-fair-e2ef7bbbc892).\n\t- Each Bitcoin can be divided into 100 million satoshis (sats), so anyone buying into Bitcoin can buy a thousandth of a pound, assuming they can find someone willing to transact that with them.\n\t- Satoshi Nakamoto (the name of the publishing entity) [disappeared from the forums](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/what-happened-when-bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-disappeared) forever in 2010. Bitcoin has the marks of cypherpunks and anarcho-capitalism. The IMF has recently conceded that Bitcoin [poses a risk](https://blogs.imf.org/2022/01/11/crypto-prices-move-more-in-sync-with-stocks-posing-new-risks/) to traditional financial systems, so it could be argued that it is succeeding in this original aim. There is a detailed section on [[Digital Asset Risks]] in these pages.\n\t- It is already a mature ecosystem, with [enterprise-grade software](https://www.fortris.com/) stacks, and is seeing adoption as a [corporate treasury asset](https://bitcointreasuries.net/).\n\n\t- ### 6.  **InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)**\n\t- **Overview**: IPFS is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system.

Bindings available in Rust, Dart, and other languages.\n\t- **Goals**: Enable decentralized apps without reliance on centralized corporate systems.\n- Key features include strong cryptography, ability to run on a variety ofplatforms, distributed and replicated data storage, and private routingto provide IP privacy. The decentralized design aims to avoid issueswith centralized and corporate controlled systems.\n-\n\n- ## Web 4.0\n  The following chapter will describe how much has been done by computer scientists over the past decades to support that. From this base layer we also get the potential for secure and trust minimised identity management. This nascent field of distributed identity management is explained later. From distributed trust models we can see 'trustless' transmission of economic value. The ability to send value from one person to another person or service without a third party.\n  The rest of this book will focus on the trust and value transfer elements of this shift in internet technologies, and attempt to build a case for it's use in decentralised, open source, collaborative mixed reality applications.\n  [\\\\chapterimage]\n\t- **Platforms**: Runs on Linux, Mac, Windows, Android, iOS, and in browsers via WASM.

DRM is something that users of the internet are increasingly familiar and comfortable with. It’s somewhat debatable whether decentralising this is worthwhile. The thesis of the devel­opers of the technology seems to be that without it, control of ‘value’ will accrete over time, to one or more hegemonic controlling entities. It’s a strong argument, but there is a substantial counter argument emerging that users just don’t want this stuff. The nervousness of legislators in the USA to the attempt by Facebook/Meta to enter this peer-to-peer value transmission space is telling in terms of the perception of who is driving Web3.\n\t\t- The Money Revolution\n- Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer of ‘Circle’ venture capital, said in testimony to a US senate hearing; that Web 1 was ‘read’, Web 2 was ‘read write’, and that Web 3 will ‘read write own’. The important takeaway here is not so much this oft quoted elevator pitch for Web3, but the fact that legislative bodies now consider this technology a force which they need to be aware of and potentially contend with.\n\t- Attention developed around three core themes, ubiquitous availabilityand searchability of data, intelligent search assistants, and highlyavailable end points such as phones, and ‘internet of things’ devices.This is certainly manifesting in home devices, but few people think ofthis as a Web3 revolution.\n-\n- It’s handy here to get a feel for what this looks like. These aren’tthings that this book wishes to contribute to, or even have a firmopinion on, they’re just representative of current activity in thedecentralised web space.\n-\n\n\n## Academic Context\n\n- Brief contextual overview\n\t- Peer-to-peer (P2P) networking is a distributed architecture where nodes—computers or devices—act as both clients and servers, sharing resources such as files, bandwidth, and processing power directly without centralised coordination\n\t- The concept emerged as a response to the limitations of traditional client-server models, offering decentralisation, resilience, and scalability\n\t- Key developments and current state\n\t\t- P2P networks have evolved from early file-sharing systems like Napster to underpin modern distributed technologies, including blockchain, decentralised storage, and collaborative platforms\n\t\t- Academic foundations\n\t\t\t- The architecture is grounded in distributed systems theory, with seminal work by researchers such as David Clark and the development of protocols like BitTorrent and Kademlia\n\t\t\t- P2P is now a core topic in computer science curricula, with ongoing research into security, scalability, and privacy\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n\t- P2P networks are widely used in file sharing (e.g., BitTorrent), decentralised finance (DeFi), and distributed content delivery (e.g., IPFS)\n\t- Notable organisations and platforms\n\t\t- BitTorrent, IPFS, Ethereum, and Filecoin are prominent examples of P2P-based systems\n\t\t- UK and North England examples where relevant\n\t\t\t- The University of Manchester has contributed to research on decentralised systems and distributed ledgers\n\t\t\t- Leeds-based startups have explored P2P solutions for local energy trading and community networks\n\t\t\t- Newcastle University has been involved in projects related to P2P-based IoT and smart city applications\n\t- Technical capabilities and limitations\n\t\t- P2P networks offer high scalability and resilience, as the network grows stronger with more nodes\n\t\t- However, they face challenges in security, privacy, and regulatory compliance, particularly in the context of illegal file sharing and data protection\n\t- Standards and frameworks\n\t\t- Key standards include BitTorrent Protocol, Kademlia DHT, and IPFS\n\t\t- Frameworks like the Peer-to-Peer Infrastructure (P2P Infra) from Microsoft provide APIs for developing P2P applications\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers and sources\n\t- Clarke, D.
