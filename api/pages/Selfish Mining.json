DOI: 10.1109/EuroSP.2016.21\n- Ongoing research explores:\n  - Game-theoretic models of miner behaviour under varying network conditions.\n  - Protocol modifications to incentivise honest mining and penalise block withholding.\n  - Empirical detection methods for selfish mining in live networks.\n- The literature emphasises the delicate balance between miner incentives, network latency, and decentralisation in maintaining blockchain security.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK has contributed to blockchain security research, with universities such as the University of Manchester and University of Leeds conducting studies on consensus mechanisms and attack vectors including selfish mining.\n- North England’s fintech and blockchain innovation hubs foster collaboration between academia and industry to develop resilient blockchain protocols.\n- Regional case studies include pilot projects in Manchester exploring blockchain applications with embedded security features designed to mitigate selfish mining risks.\n- While selfish mining has not been a prominent issue in UK-based mining operations, awareness and preparedness remain high given the UK’s growing interest in decentralised finance and blockchain infrastructure.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include the integration of hybrid consensus mechanisms combining PoW with Proof of Stake (PoS) to reduce selfish mining incentives.\n- Anticipated challenges involve detecting selfish mining in increasingly complex and decentralised mining pools, especially with the rise of cross-chain mining and multi-asset platforms.\n- Research priorities focus on:\n  - Developing robust incentive-compatible protocols that align miner behaviour with network health.\n  - Enhancing real-time monitoring tools to identify selfish mining attempts.\n  - Exploring the impact of network topology and latency on selfish mining feasibility.\n- The subtle art of selfish mining may continue to evolve, but so too will the blockchain community’s countermeasures—perhaps a game of cat and mouse worthy of a Dickensian plot twist.\n\n## References\n\n1.
