What began as experimental pilots matured into production infrastructure managing billions in traditional financial assets on-chain, fundamentally bridging legacy finance with blockchain technology.\n\n    #### Market Scale and Growth\n    By April 2025, the RWA tokenization market—including stablecoins—reached a market capitalisation of nearly **$250 billion**, representing approximately 69% growth since 2024. Excluding stablecoins, the RWA tokenization market surged past **$50 billion in total assets by end-2024**, a 67% increase from the $30 billion recorded at the start of the year. This trajectory positioned RWAs as one of the fastest-growing sectors in cryptocurrency, demonstrating sustainable product-market fit beyond speculative trading.\n\n    #### Stablecoin Dominance\n    The stablecoin sector achieved a market capitalisation of **$224.9 billion by April 2025**, a 76% increase since January 2024. Stablecoins comprised **95% of the RWA market**, with **Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC** collectively accounting for 93.5% of all issuance. This concentration reflected network effects and regulatory compliance moats, though it raised centralisation concerns within the cryptocurrency community.\n\n    Stablecoins processed **$46 trillion in total transaction volume** over the past year, up 106% from the previous year. This volume exceeded Visa's annual payment volume, establishing stablecoins as critical infrastructure for global commerce, remittances, and cross-border transactions—particularly in jurisdictions with currency volatility or limited banking access.\n\n    #### Tokenised Treasuries: Institutional DeFi\n    The tokenised treasuries sector's market capitalisation climbed by an impressive **539% since early 2024**, reaching an all-time high of **$5.6 billion by April 2025**. This growth reflected institutional appetite for yield-bearing blockchain-native assets backed by U.S. government securities. Products combined Treasury yields with blockchain composability, enabling collateralised borrowing, instant settlement, and 24/7 liquidity—features impossible with traditional Treasury holdings.\n\n    **BlackRock's entry** into RWA tokenization with its tokenised fund **BUIDL** on the Ethereum network marked a watershed moment. The world's largest asset manager ($10 trillion AUM) validating blockchain infrastructure for traditional securities catalysed further institutional adoption and regulatory acceptance.\n\n    #### Real Estate and Commodity Tokenization\n    Real estate dominated the RWA space in 2024, with issuers announcing **$24 billion in tokenisation projects**, of which **$5.4 billion were already live on-chain**. Platforms including **RealT** enabled fractional property ownership with on-chain dividends, democratising access to real estate investment previously restricted to accredited investors.\n\n    Commodity-backed tokens emerged as the third major RWA category alongside stablecoins and tokenised securities, with gold-backed tokens and agricultural commodity tokens providing inflation hedges and portfolio diversification on-chain.\n\n    #### Regulatory Momentum\n    The industry awaited Senate approval of the **GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins)**, which aimed to establish clear rules for stablecoin collateralisation. The House approval of the **CLARITY Act** signalled bipartisan consensus that cryptocurrency was \"both here to stay and ready to thrive in the U.S.\" These frameworks established guidelines for stablecoins, market structure, and digital asset oversight balancing innovation with investor protection.\n\n    The passage of clarity-focused legislation accelerated institutional deployment. Legal certainty around token classification, custody requirements, and investor protection enabled large financial institutions to offer tokenised products without existential regulatory risk.\n\n    #### Leading Projects and Infrastructure\n    Key RWA projects included **Chainlink** (oracle infrastructure), **Centrifuge** (asset financing), **Goldfinch** (credit protocols), **Ondo Finance** (institutional-grade tokenised securities), **Franklin Templeton** (tokenised money market fund), **Mountain Protocol** (yield-bearing stablecoin), **RealT** (fractional real estate), and **Maple Finance** (undercollateralised lending).\n\n    The ecosystem matured from novelty to necessity, with tokenization becoming the assumed method for issuing, trading, and settling traditional securities on public blockchains. The trajectory suggested that by 2027-2028, the majority of new security issuance would occur natively on-chain, with traditional settlement infrastructure relegated to legacy asset support.\n\n    #### Token Standard Evolution: Beyond ERC-20\n\n    Whilst **ERC-20** remained the \"golden standard\" for fungible token issuance (deployed in 2015, battle-tested across billions in value transferred), 2024-2025 witnessed **specialised token standards** emerging to address RWA-specific requirements:\n\n    **Advanced RWA Token Standards:**\n    - **ERC-4626** (Tokenized Vault Standard): Standardised **yield-bearing vaults**, enabling pooled RWA products (e.g., diversified Treasury portfolios, real estate investment trusts) with unified interfaces for deposits, withdrawals, and accounting. This simplified DeFi protocol integration—lending protocols could accept any ERC-4626-compliant vault as collateral without custom integration code\n\n    - **ERC-7540** (Asynchronous Tokenized Vault): **Finalised by Ethereum in 2024**, this standard enabled **on-chain structured finance** with features impossible in traditional markets:\n      - **Asynchronous operations**: Deposits/withdrawals processed over time (matching T+2 settlement of underlying assets) rather than instant execution, mirroring traditional finance clearing whilst maintaining on-chain auditability\n      - **Multi-asset baskets**: Single token representing diversified portfolio (e.g., mixed commercial real estate across geographies)\n      - **Secondary distributions**: Built-in dividend/interest payment mechanisms\n      - **Compliance hooks**: Programmable whitelist/blacklist enforcement, KYC verification, accredited investor checks\n\n    - **ERC-3643** (Permissioned Token Standard): Implemented **allow-lists** and **off-chain compliance hooks**, enabling issuers to enforce securities regulations (transfer restrictions, accredited investor requirements) at smart contract level. This addressed regulatory requirements whilst maintaining blockchain transparency\n\n    - **ERC-1400** (Security Token Standard): Although pre-dating 2024, ERC-1400 achieved widespread institutional adoption through 2024-2025 as the **de facto security token implementation**, supporting **partitions** (different tranches with distinct rights), **controller operations** (forced transfers for legal compliance), and **document management** (attaching legal agreements to on-chain tokens)\n\n    **Blockchain Platform Dominance:**\n    - **Ethereum** maintained **overwhelming dominance** for RWA tokenization due to:\n      - **Developer ecosystem**: Largest pool of smart contract developers (over 4,000 active monthly)\n      - **Institutional trust**: Battle-tested infrastructure securing hundreds of billions\n      - **Token standard maturity**: ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, ERC-1400, ERC-4626, ERC-7540 comprehensive coverage\n      - **DeFi composability**: Tokenized assets immediately compatible with lending, trading, derivatives protocols\n\n    - **Polygon, Avalanche, Solana**: Emerged as **secondary platforms** offering lower transaction costs and faster finality, attracting use cases prioritising cost over maximal decentralisation (e.g., high-frequency trading of tokenized commodities, micro-transactions for fractional real estate shares)\n\n    #### Security Token Offerings and Secondary Market Challenges\n\n    **Primary Issuance: Security Token Offerings (STOs):**\n    - **STOs** represented **regulated alternative** to 2017-2018's unregulated Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), whereby issuers offered tokens directly to **accredited investors** or retail investors under regulatory exemptions (Regulation D, Regulation S, Regulation A+ in U.S.)\n\n    - By 2024-2025, STOs achieved **institutional respectability**: law firms (Latham & Watkins, Kirkland & Ellis), investment banks (Goldman Sachs Digital Assets), and asset managers (BlackRock, Franklin Templeton) routinely participated in tokenized security issuances, something unthinkable during the ICO era\n\n    - **Buy-and-hold limitation**: Most tokenization projects operated as **buy-and-hold investments** where investors purchased tokens directly from issuer and could only **sell back to the same entity**, not trade freely on secondary markets. This limitation reflected regulatory constraints rather than technical barriers\n\n    **Secondary Market Regulatory Barriers:**\n    - **Free trading restrictions**: Secondary market trading—where investors trade tokens peer-to-peer without issuer intermediation—faced **significantly stricter regulatory hurdles**:\n      - **Securities exchange requirements**: In most jurisdictions, platforms facilitating secondary trading of security tokens must register as **securities exchanges** or **alternative trading systems (ATS)**, requiring substantial capital, compliance infrastructure, and regulatory approval\n\n      - **Central Securities Depository (CSD) requirements**: Under **UK and EU law**, securities traded on secondary markets must be issued into a **Central Securities Depository**, which becomes the **authoritative record of ownership**. This requirement created **tension with blockchain's distributed ledger** (which blockchain is authoritative—CSD's permissioned ledger or public blockchain?)\n\n      - **Regulatory sandboxes**: Recognising this tension, both **UK's Digital Securities Sandbox** (launched 2023) and **EU DLT Pilot Regime** (launched 2023 under MiCA) provided **temporary exemptions** from CSD requirements, enabling experimentation with blockchain-native settlement. By 2025, approximately **15-20 projects** participated in these sandboxes, testing **atomic settlement** (simultaneous asset and cash transfer), **fractional ownership**, and **instant clearing**\n\n    - **Liquidity premium paradox**: The illiquidity of most tokenized securities—due to secondary market restrictions—created **ironic underperformance** compared to traditional securities. Whilst tokenization promised **24/7 trading** and **instant settlement**, regulatory constraints meant most tokenized assets traded **less frequently** than equivalent traditional securities on established exchanges\n\n    #### Utility Tokens and Governance Evolution\n\n    Beyond RWA representation, **utility tokens** and **governance tokens** matured through 2024-2025:\n\n    **Utility Token Legitimation:**\n    - DeFi protocols increasingly positioned native tokens as **utility mechanisms** rather than speculative assets, offering:\n      - **Discounted trading fees**: Token holders paid 10-50% lower fees (e.g., Binance BNB offering 25% trading fee discount)\n      - **Priority access**: Exclusive access to new product launches, leveraged trading tiers, early token sales\n      - **Governance rights**: Voting on protocol parameters, treasury allocations, upgrade proposals\n\n    - This \"utility theatre\" faced **regulatory scepticism**: authorities argued many utility claims were **post-hoc rationalisations** for what fundamentally remained **investment contracts** under securities law (Howey test: investment of money in common enterprise with expectation of profit from others' efforts)\n\n    **Governance Token Challenges:**\n    - Governance tokens faced **persistent paradoxes** explored in depth through DAO governance literature:\n      - **Low participation**: Only 5-15% of token holders typically voted on proposals\n      - **Whale dominance**: Top 1% controlled 70-85% voting power across major protocols\n      - **Apathy-activism imbalance**: Routine maintenance proposals saw minimal participation whilst controversial changes triggered coordinated campaigns—creating governance instability\n\n    #### Regulatory Frameworks: Jurisdictional Fragmentation\n\n    Token regulation remained **highly fragmented** across jurisdictions through 2024-2025, with no unified global framework:\n\n    **European Union (MiCA and DLT Pilot Regime):**\n    - **Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA)**: Effective 2024, established:\n      - **Asset-referenced tokens (ARTs)**: Stablecoins backed by basket of assets, subject to reserve requirements\n      - **E-money tokens (EMTs)**: Stablecoins backed by single fiat currency, treated as e-money under existing frameworks\n      - **Utility tokens**: Tokens providing access to goods/services, lighter regulatory treatment if no investment characteristics\n      - **Issuer authorisation**: Token issuers must obtain **license from national regulators** before operating in EU\n\n    - **DLT Pilot Regime**: Temporary framework (2023-2029) allowing **market infrastructure experimentation** with distributed ledger technology, exempting participants from certain CSD and MiFID II requirements whilst requiring **BaFin (Germany), AMF (France), or equivalent** oversight\n\n    **Singapore (MAS Framework):**\n    - **Monetary Authority of Singapore** classified tokenized RWAs as **securities** under Securities and Futures Act, requiring platforms to hold:\n      - **Capital Markets Services (CMS) license**: For dealing, custody, or fund management\n      - **Recognized Market Operator (RMO) license**: For operating secondary trading platforms\n    - Singapore's **clear regulatory taxonomy** attracted substantial RWA tokenization activity, with platforms including iSTOX, ADDX, and Tokeny operating licensed tokenization infrastructure\n\n    **United States (Fragmented State/Federal Approach):**\n    - **Federal level**: SEC maintained **aggressive enforcement** posture, treating most tokens as unregistered securities and pursuing civil enforcement actions against issuers. The 2024 **Ripple case** partial victory (XRP programmatic sales not securities) provided limited relief but left most tokens in legal limbo\n\n    - **State level**: Wyoming's **DAO LLC law** and **Digital Asset Depository Charter** attracted tokenization projects, offering state-chartered custody and legal entity frameworks. Other states (Texas, Colorado, Arizona) pursued competing pro-crypto frameworks, creating **regulatory arbitrage** opportunities\n\n    **KYC and Compliance Requirements:**\n    - Unlike permissionless DeFi (where anonymous users interact with smart contracts), **RWA tokenization required rigorous KYC/AML compliance**:\n      - **Identity verification**: Users must provide government-issued ID, proof of address, selfie verification\n      - **Accredited investor checks**: For Regulation D offerings in U.S., platforms must verify investors meet income ($200K+ annually) or net worth ($1M+ excluding primary residence) thresholds\n      - **Ongoing monitoring**: Platforms must monitor for suspicious transactions, file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) with financial intelligence units\n      - **Sanctions screening**: Real-time checks against OFAC, UN, EU sanctions lists before allowing transfers\n\n    This compliance burden created **centralisation tension**: whilst blockchain promised disintermediation, RWA tokenization required **trusted intermediaries** (custodians, KYC providers, compliance officers) comparable to traditional finance, undermining decentralisation narratives.\n\n    #### Market Projections: The $2 Trillion Decade\n\n    **McKinsey's $2 Trillion Projection:**\n    - McKinsey & Company projected tokenized asset markets could reach **$2 trillion by 2030**, representing approximately **2% of global financial assets** ($100+ trillion). This forecast assumed:\n      - **Regulatory clarity** achieved by 2026-2027 in major jurisdictions\n      - **Institutional custody infrastructure** maturation (Coinbase Custody, BitGo, Fireblocks achieving bank-grade security)\n      - **Traditional finance integration**: Major exchanges (NYSE, Nasdaq, LSE) offering tokenized security trading\n      - **Network effects**: Once critical mass achieved, tokenization becomes default for new issuances\n\n    **2025 Milestones:**\n    - Industry analysts projected **$500 billion tokenized RWAs (excluding stablecoins) by end-2025**, up from approximately $15 billion (December 2024), requiring **3,200% growth**—ambitious but reflecting exponential adoption curves typical of network-effect technologies\n\n    - **Stablecoins** already exceeded $250 billion by mid-2025, demonstrating that token infrastructure could support massive value transfer at scale\n\n    #### Challenges and Persistent Skepticism\n\n    Despite explosive growth and institutional validation, RWA tokenization faced **persistent challenges**:\n\n    **Technical Risks:**\n    - **Smart contract vulnerabilities**: Bugs in token contracts could enable theft, unauthorized minting, or transfer freezes—with billion-dollar consequences for institutional RWAs\n    - **Oracle dependence**: Off-chain data (asset valuations, NAVs, compliance status) required **trusted oracles** (Chainlink, Tellor), reintroducing centralisation\n    - **Chain finality**: Blockchain reorganizations (reorgs) could invalidate ownership records, creating legal ambiguity\n\n    **Economic Questions:**\n    - **Value proposition skepticism**: Critics argued tokenization offered **marginal improvements** over existing infrastructure (e.g., T+0 settlement vs. T+2) whilst introducing **new risks** (smart contract exploits, key management)—insufficient value for institutional migration costs\n\n    - **Liquidity fragmentation**: Tokenized versions of assets traded on **multiple chains** (Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche) **fragmented liquidity**, reducing price efficiency compared to centralised exchanges concentrating order books\n\n    **Regulatory Uncertainty:**\n    - **Jurisdictional arbitrage risks**: Platforms incorporated in permissive jurisdictions (Cayman Islands, BVI) whilst serving global users created **enforcement challenges** and potential for regulatory evasion\n\n    - **Securities law evolution**: Unclear whether tokenized assets represented **new asset class** requiring bespoke regulation or **existing securities** in new form—with profound implications for custody, disclosure, insider trading rules\n\n    The 2024-2025 period represented tokenization's **transition from proof-of-concept to production infrastructure**, yet fundamental questions remained about whether blockchain offered **revolutionary efficiency** justifying migration costs or merely **incremental improvements** destined to remain niche use cases within broader traditional finance dominance.\n  -\n  - ### Standards & References\n    id:: token-standards\n  -\n\n\t\t- #### **3.

They are generally[recognised inlaw](https://www.signaturelitigation.com/nfts-recognised-as-property-lavinia-deborah-osbourne-v-1-persons-unknown-2-ozone-networks-inc-trading-as-opensea/)as property in their own right.[[moringiello2021property; @fairfield2021tokenized]] In the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and project tokens detailed earlier, and limitingthis description to the Ethereum network for now, a project launching anERC-20 token commits contract code to the blockchain, and this contractthen mediates the issuance and management of millions or billions oftokens associated with that project, and it’s use case.[ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/)is a [fungible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility) tokenissuance. Each of the projects’ tokens is interchangeable with any othertoken. They’re all the same from the point of view of the user.\n\t- Rather than the ERC-20 contract type used for fungible token issuance, NFTs predominantly use the ERC-721 protocol on Ethereum (just different instructions). It’s the case that most NFTs in the 2021/2 hype bubble are algorithmically generated sets of themed art (so-called PFP-NFT). Tens of thousands of distinct tokens are ‘minted’, each one being a complex transaction commitment to the Ethereum blockchain, along with its associated gas fee. These minting events were much-hyped social occasions (before the [2022 market crash](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/02/nft-sales-hit-12-month-low-after-cryptocurrency-crash?)), and happened very quickly, with users clamouring to create art with randomly allocated features from the art schema associated with the project. Lucky winners could find themselves with an NFT art piece with more than an average number of ‘rare’ features. If the overall mint becomes more popular, then the secondary market for all of those mints goes up, and because of the liquidity premium, they can go up a lot. The perceived rarer mints go up a lot more. This whole process is [very energy intensive](https://memoakten.medium.com/the-unreasonable-ecological-cost-of-cryptoart-2221d3eb2053) on the chain, and the vast majority of these projects simply [trend to zero value](https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/non-fungible-tokens-can-we-predict-price-theyll-sell). In response to this appalling cost-benefit analysis, the Ethereum Foundation has proposed [EIP-2309](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2309) to make minting NFTs more efficient. They say, “This standard lets you mint as many as you like in one transaction!”\n\t- The Ethereum Foundation gives their somewhat constrained view of [NFTs on their website](https://ethereum.org/en/nft/) and it’s a useful primer. On that page, they detail some of the use cases, as listed below, with a critique added:\n\t\t- Digital content; this is the dominant use case right now. Much more on this later.\n\t\t- Gaming items; again more on this later, it’s an obvious enough use case but [complex politics](https://climatereplay.org/nfts/nft-digital-ownership-pledge/) in the intersection of games and crypto have stalled the adoption curve.\n\t\t- Domain names; this is just starting to reach for applications now, why not a database with the ISP/host?\n\t\t- Physical items; seemed like a clear over-reach as the transfer of the NFT does not imply the transfer of the object, but this is emerging as the growth use case.\n\t\t- Investments and collateral; while this was an emergent option in the space, it’s likely been a bubble, as owners of the tokens cast around for additional liquidity, and loan businesses chased yield with higher risk. The [recent implosion](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/three-arrows-capital-grayscale-maker-lido) of lenders and funds in the crypto space was partly a function of supposedly world-class risk managers accepting jpegs as collateral.\n\t- Moving away from Ethereum, NFTs can be minted on most of the other levelone chains. Solana is a great newcomer example. Sol is a terrible chainwith regards to decentralisation, but thanks to that it’s far cheaperand faster to mint NFTs on it, and it was becoming a [troublingcompetitor](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/ethereum-eth-killers-nfts-defi-solana-cardano-wax-crypto-investing-2022-1)for Eth before the FTX ponzi scheme collapse destroyed it’s market value(Figure<a href=\"#fig:solnfts\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"fig:solnfts\">[fig:solnfts]</a>).\n\t  ![image](./assets/c79e0ea22ab5fa6fac6fa22abbe87ab19f6ef244.jpg){:height 1068, :width 913}\n\t- The same might be true for Cardano’s ADA, though ADA is struggling tohold onto it’s market position despite some technical advances. It’sworth reiterating here that the nature of these digital tools likelymakes for a ‘winner take all’ market dynamic over time. With fees beingcentral to this generative NFT use case it’s possible to see that highlycentralised, fast, and cheap chains will capture and eventually dominatethe space. Remember that this likely (game theoretic) outcome might aswell be a database running without the stark inefficiencies ofblockchain. The whole NFT space is a gamble on consumer enthusiasm forspending money continuing to outpace logic.\n\t- Astonishingly, according to a JPMorgan insider market report ([reportedon in apodcast](https://www.coindesk.com/podcasts/the-breakdown-with-nlw/jpmorgan-bitcoin-shows-some-merit-as-a-store-of-value/)),only around 2 million people have ever actually interacted with NFTs.One analysis suggests that a single entity accounts for 3 of the top 4holders, having made 32,000 ETH from the NFT boom. This suggests heavymarket manipulation and is far from the egalitarian landscape claimed inthe hype. Tellingly it’s thought around [10% of the tradingvolume](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/three-arrows-wanted-100m-nft-161811450.html)on market leading platform ‘Super Rare’ was by the now bankrupt venturecapital firm ‘Three Arrows’.\n\t- With that said NFTs have clearly allowed [digital and new mediaartists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_non-fungible_tokens)to connect with audiences without gatekeepers. Established mediators andcurators of art have been caught totally wrongfooted, and NFTs seem togive a way for them to be cut out completely. There are suggestions ofapplications beyond this initial digital art scope. This is acompounding, and disrupting paradigm change.\n\n\t\t\t- ##### On sale transfer\n\t\t\t\t- 20% of total sale amount into digital wallet of the creator. 80% oftotal sale amount into digital wallet of the seller.\n\t\t\t\t- Once the royalty payment rate is set by the artist/creator, futureroyalties of all sales can be paid directly to the artist/creatoraccount (via a digital wallet) without the need of a third party(traditionally a gallery/agent etc..).\n\t\t\t\t- Smart contract driven NFT’s means that even if piece of art is resold 5,10 or even a 100,000 times moving through 5, 10 or even a 100,000different collectors; a pre-determined royalty payment rate set by thecreator would still guarantee the artist/creator is paid directly fromeach and every future sale.\n\t\t\t\t- Historically provenance for works of art may span across generations,for instance Gabriël Metsu’s oil on canvas painting *The Lace Maker’s*provenance, first recorded in 1722, now spans 300 years of ownership,including from a British Baron in the 19superscriptth century to anAmerican philanthropist in the 20superscriptth century.) Metsu diedyoung at the age of 38, leaving a widow; neither his/herrelatives/descendants benefit from his original work, 300 years laterthis would be near impossible to facilitate with traditional systems, aseven legal contracts are open and prone to the ravages of time.\n\t\t\t\t- NFT smart contracts hold an incredibly potential; an artists descendantsfinancially benefiting directly from the resale of a piece of work longafter the artist/museum’s/gallery or even state have turned to dust aslong as the original creator’s digital wallet is accessible, *theblockhain becomes an everlasting digital patron* ensuring\n\t\t\t\t- NFT art currently suffers from the same failure of decentralisationalready discussed in the Ethererum technology stack, but this iscompounded by the normalisation of intermediate art brokers [continuingto custody](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html)the NFTs even after sale. They are usually selling a pointer to theirown servers. The market is nascent and evolving, but it’s currently notdelivering on it’s core promise.\n\t\t\t\t- Proof of ownership is intuitively a pretty obvious application for thetechnology, but again it’s hard to justify the expense when the benefitsare so slim. [Bulldogs on theblockchain](https://www.bullishlybred.com/) is a clear gimmick, andmight even incentivise poor behaviours as there are two products herewhich are not necessarily aligned. Much has been written over the yearsabout [deeds to property](https://propy.com/browse/propy-nft/) beingpassed through blockchains, cutting out the middle man, but in the eventthat a house deed NFT was hacked and stolen it’s obviously not the casethat the property would then pass to the hacker.\n\t\t\t\t- One of the most interesting companies is Yuga Labs, who launched theincredibly popular Bored Ape Yacht club set of 10,000 algorithmicallygenerated NFTs. These Ethereum based NFTs were based loosely on the‘Crypto Punks’ model of PFP-NFT (variously profile picture project,picture for proof, and picture for profile\n\t\t\t\t- no definition remainsuncontested for long). Yuga launched with a better commercialisationmodel for the holders, and a strong marketing drive into celebritycircles. They now regularly change hands for hundreds of thousands ofpounds. Even this ‘blue chip’ NFT is not without [seriouscriticism](https://twitter.com/coryklippsten/status/1538909505236283392):it“I’d put it at 99.99% the project is in fact a deliberate troll,intentionally replete with Nazi symbols and esoteric racist dogwhistles”\n\t\t\t\t- Yuga recently bought the artistic rights to the commercial reuse ofsimilarly popular (and preceding) Punks set. This is interesting becausethey have again handed the commercial re-use rights to the owners of theindividual NFTs. This raises the same [confusingproblem](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-21/bored-ape-nft-spinoff-venture-gone-sour-sparks-legal-fight)with attaching commercial rights to an easily stolen token as NFTs forreal estate does. This has been demonstrated recently when Seth Greenhad a Bored Ape stolen after [creating an animated show around it’sIP](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sarahemerson/seth-green-bored-ape-stolen-tv-show).Many more contradictions and ambiguities in NFT licenses are emerging.Galaxy Digital have [surveyed thelandscape](https://www.galaxy.com/research/insights/a-survey-of-nft-licenses-facts-and-fictions/):it“Contrary to the ethos of Web3, NFTs today convey exactly zeroownership rights for the underlying artwork to their token holders.Instead, the arrangements between NFT issuers and token holders resemblea distinctly web maze of opaque, misleading, complex, and restrictivelicensing agreements, and popular secondary markets like OpenSea provideno material disclosures regarding these arrangements to purchasers.Something more is required, and that ‘something’ is a legal agreementbetween the owner of the image—known as the ‘copyright holder’ and theNFT holder specifying what rights the NFT holder has with respect to theimage. To the extent an NFT purchaser has any rights to the imageassociated with his or her NFT at all, those rights flow not from his orher ownership of the token, but from the terms and conditions containedin the license issued by the NFT Project governing the NFT holder’spurchase and use of the image. Accordingly, for the vast majority of NFTprojects, owning the NFT does not mean you own the corresponding digitalcontent that is displayed when you sync your wallet to OpenSea. Thatcontent, as it turns out, is owned and retained by the owner of thecopyright associated with that digital content, typically the NFTproject. After reviewing the most used license agreements for NFTprojects, it becomes apparent that NFT standards and smart contracts donot recognize off-chain law.” There may already be a response from theindustry to this in the shape of [a16z’s “can’t be evil” licenseproposal](https://a16zcrypto.com/introducing-nft-licenses/).\n\t\t\t\t- Even so, the community around these collections is incredibly strong,mixing developers, artists, the rich and famous, and the fortunate andearly, into a cohesive community who communicate online. The developer‘good will’ is enormous, and it seems possible that this will lead tofaster and broader innovation around the collections, and out into[metaverseapplications](https://twitter.com/yugalabs/status/1505014986556551172?).The brand is strong, and the individual NFT items both benefit from, andreinforce that brand, while adding personal narratives and humaninterest.\n\t\t\t\t- As a gauge of how frothy this market still is it’s interesting to lookat the APE token which Yuga just launched. They airdropped 10,000 of thetokens free to each of the 10,000 NFT holders. This instantly created amulti-billion dollar market cap, and a top 50 ‘crypto’ out of thin air,based purely on their brand. It’s clear that there is both brand, and amarket here.\n\t\t\t\t- A recent report from \"Base Layer\" tries to capture the community‘feature’ of big brand NFTs. [“Crypto culturedecoded”](https://baselayer.so/crypto-culture-decoded) explains that isis these online communities which are the attraction not necessarily theart. This is a powerful ‘in group’ argument, though speculation remainsthe most likely underpinning.\n\t\t\t\t- While it is likely that this is currently a speculative bubble, that is[waning already](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61102759) (Figure<a href=\"#fig:monkey\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"fig:monkey\">[fig:monkey]</a>),it seems certain that the technology is here to stay in some form.\n\t\t\t\t  ![image](./assets/8b0f2b24b70d1083878b139fb04cb6001e4acf56.jpg)\n\n\t- ##### BRC-20\n\t\t- BRC-20 tokens are fungible tokens that are created by attaching a JSONto satoshis through Bitcoin ordinals. The JSON code bit defines everycharacteristic of the BRC-20 token including the minting, anddistribution, the bitcoin network decodes this information once they aredeployed. BRC-20 tokens are minted and spent like normal tokens. BRC-20tokens utilize Ordinals inscriptions of JSON (JavaScript ObjectNotation) data to deploy token contracts, mint, and transfer tokens.Currently, the BRC-20 token standard allows creating a BRC-20 token withthe deploy function, minting an amount of BRC-20 tokens with the mintfunction, and transferring an amount of BRC-20 tokens via the transferfunction. It’s notable that for purely fungible assets that don’trequire smart contract functionality (which is most of them) BRC-20 issuperior to Ethereum’s ERC-20 in simplicity, security, and the fairnessof the minting process. The community seems very split on this use ofthe chain, and it’s impact on transaction fee markets.\n\n\t- ### Web5, Bluesky, & Microsoft ION\n\t\t- Promisingly Jack Dorsey’s company TBD is working on a project [called“Web5”](https://developer.tbd.website/projects/web5/).

They are generally[recognised inlaw](https://www.signaturelitigation.com/nfts-recognised-as-property-lavinia-deborah-osbourne-v-1-persons-unknown-2-ozone-networks-inc-trading-as-opensea/)as property in their own right.[[moringiello2021property; @fairfield2021tokenized]] In the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and project tokens detailed earlier, and limitingthis description to the Ethereum network for now, a project launching anERC-20 token commits contract code to the blockchain, and this contractthen mediates the issuance and management of millions or billions oftokens associated with that project, and it’s use case.[ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/)is a [fungible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility) tokenissuance. Each of the projects’ tokens is interchangeable with any othertoken. They’re all the same from the point of view of the user.\n\t- Rather than the ERC-20 contract type used for fungible token issuance, NFTs predominantly use the ERC-721 protocol on Ethereum (just different instructions). It’s the case that most NFTs in the 2021/2 hype bubble are algorithmically generated sets of themed art (so-called PFP-NFT). Tens of thousands of distinct tokens are ‘minted’, each one being a complex transaction commitment to the Ethereum blockchain, along with its associated gas fee. These minting events were much-hyped social occasions (before the [2022 market crash](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/02/nft-sales-hit-12-month-low-after-cryptocurrency-crash?)), and happened very quickly, with users clamouring to create art with randomly allocated features from the art schema associated with the project. Lucky winners could find themselves with an NFT art piece with more than an average number of ‘rare’ features. If the overall mint becomes more popular, then the secondary market for all of those mints goes up, and because of the liquidity premium, they can go up a lot. The perceived rarer mints go up a lot more. This whole process is [very energy intensive](https://memoakten.medium.com/the-unreasonable-ecological-cost-of-cryptoart-2221d3eb2053) on the chain, and the vast majority of these projects simply [trend to zero value](https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/non-fungible-tokens-can-we-predict-price-theyll-sell). In response to this appalling cost-benefit analysis, the Ethereum Foundation has proposed [EIP-2309](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2309) to make minting NFTs more efficient. They say, “This standard lets you mint as many as you like in one transaction!”\n\t- The Ethereum Foundation gives their somewhat constrained view of [NFTs on their website](https://ethereum.org/en/nft/) and it’s a useful primer. On that page, they detail some of the use cases, as listed below, with a critique added:\n\t\t- Art as NFT’s offer the following advantages:\n\n\t- ### Web5, Bluesky, & Microsoft ION\n\t\t- Promisingly Jack Dorsey’s company TBD is working on a project [called“Web5”](https://developer.tbd.website/projects/web5/).

Let me break down the key components:\n\n- #### Ether Ultra Hard Money Narrative\n\t- Part of the challenge Ethereum faces is wrapped up with its complex token emission schedule. This is the rate at which tokens are generated and ‘burnt’ or destroyed in the network. The total supply of tokens is uncertain, and both emission and burn schedules are regularly tinkered with by the project. The changes to the rate at which ETH are generated.\n\t  \n\t\t- **Scalability Trap:** Attempts to scale the platform and lower fees would, counterintuitively, reduce Ethereum’s intrinsic value by decreasing its future cash flows.\n\t- This presents a catch-22 situation where Ethereum’s value is fundamentally limited by its own economic model. If the asset’s value drops significantly, it could undermine the security of the entire platform, making it less reliable for settling large transactions.\n\t- In the long run, this creates a feedback loop that could, theoretically, push Ethereum’s value towards zero. This issue casts a shadow over Ethereum’s long-term viability, presenting a challenge that goes beyond mere technical scalability.\n\n- ## Next Word/Token Prediction\n\t- **Method:** This technique unlocks the entire body of human text as a potential training dataset. Imagine having access to every book, article, blog post, and conversation ever written.\n\t- **Process:** The AI system learns by predicting the next word in a sequence. It takes into account the preceding words, trying to decipher the underlying grammar, semantics, and even the author's style.\n\t- **Process:** Instead of relying on labeled datasets, we intentionally degrade images by adding noise. This could be random pixels, blurring, or other forms of distortion. The AI's task is to learn to reverse this degradation, reconstructing the original, pristine image.\n\t- **Concept:** By learning to remove noise, the AI learns to identify the fundamental features and patterns within an image. It becomes better at distinguishing between real details and random noise. This process is similar to how our own brains filter out distractions to focus on relevant information.\n\t- **Significance:** This approach opens up a vast new world of possibilities for training AI systems, enabling them to learn from unlabeled image data.\n\t\t- **Tokens:** Words or image fragments are represented as numerical embeddings, called tokens. These tokens allow the AI to process language and images in a numerical way.\n\t\t- **Neurons:** Neurons are the individual nodes within the AI network. They are typically organized into layers, with each layer performing a specific task.\n\t\t- **Activations:** The values at specific neurons are called activations. These activations indicate how active a particular neuron is, providing insights into the AI's internal decision-making process.\n\t- **Significance:** This example demonstrates that AI systems can learn complex concepts like sentiment without explicit instructions. They learn to represent these concepts internally, using them to perform their primary task more effectively.\n\t- **Concept:** This idea, of semantics (meaning) emerging from a syntactic (structure) process, is crucial to understanding the power of AI.\n\n- #### Ether Ultra Hard Money Narrative\n\t- Part of the challenge Ethereum faces is wrapped up with its complex token emission schedule. This is the rate at which tokens are generated and ‘burnt’ or destroyed in the network. The total supply of tokens is uncertain, and both emission and burn schedules are regularly tinkered with by the project. The changes to the rate at which ETH are generated.\n\t  \n\t  ![Image](./assets/3fe8a20a55cfa025f4f59f7b04483196d7f28708.png)\n\t- The rate of token generation has changed unpredictably over time. Rights requested.\n\t- In addition, a recent upgrade (EIP-1559) results in tokens now being burnt at a higher rate than they are produced, deliberately leading to a diminishing supply. In theory, this increases the value of each ETH on the network at around 1% per year. It’s very complex, with impacts on transaction fees, waiting time, and consensus security, as examined by Liu et al.[[liu2022empirical]]. Additionally, there is now talk (by [Buterin](https://time.com/6158182/vitalik-buterin-ethereum-profile/), the creator of Ethereum) of extending this burn mechanism [further into the network](https://ethresear.ch/t/multidimensional-eip-1559/11651).\n- Ethereum was designed from the beginning to move to a ‘proof of stake’ model where token holders underpin network consensus through complex automated voting systems based upon their token holding. This is now called [Ethereum Consensus Layer](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/01/24/the-great-eth2-renaming/). This recent ‘Merge’ upgrade has reduced the carbon footprint of the network, a laudable thing, though it seems the GPUs and data centres have just gone on to be elsewhere. It has not lowered the cost to users nor improved performance. As part of the switching roadmap, users were asked to lock up 32 ETH tokens each (a substantial allocation of capital). In total, there are around 14 million of these tokens, and it is those users who now control the network. This money is likely stuck on the network until at least 2024, a significant delay when compared to the original promises.\n- This means that proof of stake has problems in that the majority owners ‘decide’ the truth of the chain to a degree and must by design have the ability to override prior consensus choices. Remember that these users are now trapped in their positions. Four major entities now control the rules of the chain and have already agreed to censor certain banned addresses. Proof of stake is probably inherently broken[[poelstra2015stake]]. This has [f](https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd)or malicious actors who have sufficient control of the existing history of the chain, thought to be [in the region of $50M](https://twitter.com/MTorgin/status/1521433474820890624)[[mackinga2022twap]]. Like much of the rest of ‘crypto’, the proposed changes will concentrate decisions and economic rewards in the hands of major players, early investors, and incumbents.\n- ![image.png](assets/image_1742487476628_0.png)\n- This is a far cry from the stated aims of the technology. The move to proof of stake has recently earned it the [MIT breakthrough technology award](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/02/23/1044960/proof-of-stake-cryptocurrency/), despite not being complete (validators cannot yet sell their voting stakes). It’s clearly a technology that is designed to innovate at the expense of predictability. This might work out very well for the platform, but right now the barrier to participation (in gas fees) is so high that we do not intend for Ethereum to be in scope as a method for value transfer within metaverses.\n\n- #### Web5, Bluesky, & Microsoft ION\n- Promisingly Jack Dorsey’s company TBD is working on a project [called“Web5”](https://developer.tbd.website/projects/web5/). Details are scantbut the promise is decentralised and/or self hosted data and identityrunning on Bitcoin, without recourse to a new token. it“Componentsinclude decentralized identifiers (DIDs), decentralized web node (DWNs),self-sovereign identity service (SSIS) and a self-sovereign identitysoftware development kit (ssi-sdk)”.\n- Web5 leverages the ION identity stack. All this looks to be exactly whatour metaverse system requires, but the complexity is likely to be quitehigh as it is to be built on existing DID/SSI research which is prettycomplex and perhaps has problems.\n- They readily admit they [do not have a workingsolution](https://atproto.com/guides/identity) at this time: it“Atpresent, none of the DID methods meet our standards fully. Many existingDID networks are permissionless blockchains which achieve the abovegoals but with relatively poor latency (ION takes roughly 20 minutes forcommitment finality). Therefore we have chosen to support did-web and atemporary method we’ve created called did-placeholder. We expect thissituation to evolve as new solutions emerge.”\n\n- ## High level analysis\n\t- It seems possible that eight value propositions are therefore emerging:\n\t  id:: 661d5f6a-ce5e-479e-8722-2128890607bd\n\t\t- Bitcoin the speculative asset (or greater fool bubble [66]). Nations such as the USA, who own 30% of the asset have bid up the price of the tokens during a period of very cheap money, and this has led to a high valuation for the tokens, with a commensurately high network security through the hash rate (mining). This could be a speculative bubble, with the asset shifting to one of the other valuations below. There is more on this subject in the money section later.\n\t\t- Gambling, the \"Financial nihilism use case\", is well explained by Travis Kling in a twitter thread. \"Number go up\" is clearly the predominant use case at this time for both Bitcoin and crypto. Kling's analysis paints a vivid picture of the current socio-economic climate, where financial nihilism—stemming from stifling cost of living, dwindling upward mobility, and an untenable ratio of median home prices to median income—fuels speculative gambling within the crypto space. This atmosphere encourages individuals to invest in highly speculative assets with the slim hope of substantial returns, akin to purchasing lottery tickets. In this context, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become vehicles for extreme risk-taking, driven not by a belief in their fundamental value but by the desperation and desire for a quick financial win in a system perceived as increasingly rigged against the average person. Kling's observations suggest that for many, the gamble on cryptocurrencies is less about informed investment and more about the desperate swing for the fences, embodying a form of financial nihilism that sees traditional avenues of wealth accumulation as blocked or insufficient. This speculative gamble is further fueled by the allure of significant gains, regardless of the inherent risks or the long-term sustainability of such investments.\n\t\t- [twitter link to the render loading below](https://twitter.com/Travis_Kling/status/1753455596462878815)\n\t\t  {{twitter https://twitter.com/Travis_Kling/status/1753455596462878815}}\n\t\t- Bitcoin the (human) monetary network, and ‘emerging market’ value transfer mechanism. This will be most useful for Africa (especially Nigeria), India, and South America. There is no sense of the “value” of this network at this time, but it’s the aspect we need for our collaborative mixed reality application. For this use the price must simply be high enough to ensure that mining viably secures the network. This security floor is unfortunately a ‘known unknown’. If a global Bitcoin monetary axis evolves (as in the Money chapter later) the network would certainly require a higher rate than currently, suggestive of a higher price of token to ensure mining [67].\n\t\t- Bitcoin as an autonomous AI monetary network. In an era where AI actors perform tasks on behalf of humans in digital realms such as cyberspace, these AI actors will require a reliable and efficient means of transaction. AI agents can perform, transact and negotiate, and execute work contracts in near real-time. For this use, the primary requirement is not a high token price, but rather a high level of network security and scalability that can support an enormous volume of transactions.\n\t\t- The Lightning Network of Bitcoin might be a starting point but the robustness of the system, against potential AI exploits, is yet to be confirmed. As AI systems become more complex and autonomous, there is an increasing need for decentralized AI governance mechanisms that can prevent the concentration of power and ensure ethical AI development and deployment. Bitcoin can serve as a basis for this, providing a decentralized, transparent, and immutable record of AI decisions and actions. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s proof-of-work consensus mechanism could potentially be adapted to enforce AI adherence to agreed-upon rules or norms. In this context, Bitcoin’s value extends beyond its token price and into its potential contributions to AI governance and ethics.\n\t\t- This is Bitcoin as an AI economy. It's notable that scaling solutions like [[Cashu]] and or [[RGB and Client Side Validation]] are likely required in addition to more established technologies like [[Lightning and Similar L2]]; this technical landscape isn't quite ready. -\n\t\t- Bitcoin as a hedge against future quantum computation. It has been argued that the advent of quantum computers could threaten the security of many existing cryptographic systems. Bitcoin’s open-source nature allows for the integration of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, safeguarding it against quantum threats. In this sense, investment in Bitcoin might also be seen as an investment in a future-proof monetary network. This assertion depends on the assumption that Bitcoin’s protocol will adapt in time to incorporate such cryptographic advances before quantum computing becomes a real threat to its integrity. The practical implementation of these technologies might see a shift in the network’s dynamics, the hash rate, mining cost, and token value.\n\t\t- Bitcoin’s value in terms of ‘sunk opportunity cost’. This refers to the value that could have been generated if the resources invested in a particular activity had been utilised elsewhere. In the context of Bitcoin, this includes the investments made in mining equipment, power, facilities, and the hiring of skilled personnel to maintain the operations. The sunk opportunity cost of Bitcoin can be substantial. It can be argued that the value of Bitcoin must take this cost into consideration, as the resources could have been allocated to other productive sectors or investments [68]. Of course, there remains the infamous sunk cost fallacy, which refers to the tendency of individuals or organizations to continue investing in a project or decision based on the amount of resources already spent, rather than evaluating the current and future value of the investment. This indeed tends to lead to a cyclical boom and bust dynamic in the industrial mining communities. The ultimate fallacy would occur if miners or investors continued to invest in mining equipment and operations solely because of the resources that have already been spent on them, and the asset simply crashes to nothing from here. It’s a shaky justification because it assumes the future is the same as the past. -\n\t\t- Bitcoin as a flexible load in power distribution systems, and methane mitigation ‘asset’, and ‘subsidised heater’ for varied applications such as growing and drying. Again there is no price against this, but we can perhaps grossly estimate it at around half the current hash rate if 50% of the network is currently green energy. This would imply a price for the asset roughly where it is now (ie, not orders of magnitude higher or lower). -\n\t\t- The 2023 global bank runs have awoken some companies to the risks of access to cash flows in a potential crisis [69]. Access to a small cache (in corporate treasury terms) of a highly liquid & tradable asset could allow continuity of payroll in a ‘24/7’ global context. This could avoid or at least mitigate the panic which ensues in companies when banks are forces to suddenly wind up their operations.\n\t\t- Amusingly Ben Hunt suggests in an online article that the true value of Bitcoin can be couched in terms of it’s value simply as ‘art’. He posits that at this time the narrative is simply so seductive and powerful that people (being people) are choosing to value their involvement in the economics of the space as they might a work of art. It’s a fascinating idea, and intuitively, probably it’s right.\n\n- #### Ether Ultra Hard Money Narrative\n\t- Part of the challenge Ethereum faces is wrapped up with its complex token emission schedule. This is the rate at which tokens are generated and ‘burnt’ or destroyed in the network. The total supply of tokens is uncertain, and both emission and burn schedules are regularly tinkered with by the project. The changes to the rate at which ETH are generated.\n\t  \n\t  ![Image](./assets/3fe8a20a55cfa025f4f59f7b04483196d7f28708.png)\n\t- The rate of token generation has changed unpredictably over time. Rights requested.\n\t- In addition, a recent upgrade (EIP-1559) results in tokens now being burnt at a higher rate than they are produced, deliberately leading to a diminishing supply. In theory, this increases the value of each ETH on the network at around 1% per year. It’s very complex, with impacts on transaction fees, waiting time, and consensus security, as examined by Liu et al.[[liu2022empirical]]. Additionally, there is now talk (by [Buterin](https://time.com/6158182/vitalik-buterin-ethereum-profile/), the creator of Ethereum) of extending this burn mechanism [further into the network](https://ethresear.ch/t/multidimensional-eip-1559/11651).\n- Ethereum was designed from the beginning to move to a ‘proof of stake’ model where token holders underpin network consensus through complex automated voting systems based upon their token holding. This is now called [Ethereum Consensus Layer](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/01/24/the-great-eth2-renaming/). This recent ‘Merge’ upgrade has reduced the carbon footprint of the network, a laudable thing, though it seems the GPUs and data centres have just gone on to be elsewhere. It has not lowered the cost to users nor improved performance. As part of the switching roadmap, users were asked to lock up 32 ETH tokens each (a substantial allocation of capital). In total, there are around 14 million of these tokens, and it is those users who now control the network. This money is likely stuck on the network until at least 2024, a significant delay when compared to the original promises.\n- This means that proof of stake has problems in that the majority owners ‘decide’ the truth of the chain to a degree and must by design have the ability to override prior consensus choices. Remember that these users are now trapped in their positions. Four major entities now control the rules of the chain and have already agreed to censor certain banned addresses. Proof of stake is probably inherently broken[[poelstra2015stake]]. This has [f](https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd)or malicious actors who have sufficient control of the existing history of the chain, thought to be [in the region of $50M](https://twitter.com/MTorgin/status/1521433474820890624)[[mackinga2022twap]]. Like much of the rest of ‘crypto’, the proposed changes will concentrate decisions and economic rewards in the hands of major players, early investors, and incumbents.\n- ![image.png](assets/image_1742487476628_0.png)\n- This is a far cry from the stated aims of the technology. The move to proof of stake has recently earned it the [MIT breakthrough technology award](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/02/23/1044960/proof-of-stake-cryptocurrency/), despite not being complete (validators cannot yet sell their voting stakes). It’s clearly a technology that is designed to innovate at the expense of predictability. This might work out very well for the platform, but right now the barrier to participation (in gas fees) is so high that we do not intend for Ethereum to be in scope as a method for value transfer within metaverses.\n\n- #### Web5, Bluesky, & Microsoft ION\n- Promisingly Jack Dorsey’s company TBD is working on a project [called“Web5”](https://developer.tbd.website/projects/web5/). Details are scantbut the promise is decentralised and/or self hosted data and identityrunning on Bitcoin, without recourse to a new token. it“Componentsinclude decentralized identifiers (DIDs), decentralized web node (DWNs),self-sovereign identity service (SSIS) and a self-sovereign identitysoftware development kit (ssi-sdk)”.\n- Web5 leverages the ION identity stack. All this looks to be exactly whatour metaverse system requires, but the complexity is likely to be quitehigh as it is to be built on existing DID/SSI research which is prettycomplex and perhaps has problems.\n- They readily admit they [do not have a workingsolution](https://atproto.com/guides/identity) at this time: it“Atpresent, none of the DID methods meet our standards fully. Many existingDID networks are permissionless blockchains which achieve the abovegoals but with relatively poor latency (ION takes roughly 20 minutes forcommitment finality). Therefore we have chosen to support did-web and atemporary method we’ve created called did-placeholder. We expect thissituation to evolve as new solutions emerge.”\n\n- ## High level analysis\n\t- It seems possible that eight value propositions are therefore emerging:\n\t  id:: 661d5f6a-ce5e-479e-8722-2128890607bd\n\t\t- Bitcoin the speculative asset (or greater fool bubble [66]). Nations such as the USA, who own 30% of the asset have bid up the price of the tokens during a period of very cheap money, and this has led to a high valuation for the tokens, with a commensurately high network security through the hash rate (mining). This could be a speculative bubble, with the asset shifting to one of the other valuations below. There is more on this subject in the money section later.\n\t\t- Gambling, the \"Financial nihilism use case\", is well explained by Travis Kling in a twitter thread. \"Number go up\" is clearly the predominant use case at this time for both Bitcoin and crypto. Kling's analysis paints a vivid picture of the current socio-economic climate, where financial nihilism—stemming from stifling cost of living, dwindling upward mobility, and an untenable ratio of median home prices to median income—fuels speculative gambling within the crypto space. This atmosphere encourages individuals to invest in highly speculative assets with the slim hope of substantial returns, akin to purchasing lottery tickets. In this context, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become vehicles for extreme risk-taking, driven not by a belief in their fundamental value but by the desperation and desire for a quick financial win in a system perceived as increasingly rigged against the average person. Kling's observations suggest that for many, the gamble on cryptocurrencies is less about informed investment and more about the desperate swing for the fences, embodying a form of financial nihilism that sees traditional avenues of wealth accumulation as blocked or insufficient. This speculative gamble is further fueled by the allure of significant gains, regardless of the inherent risks or the long-term sustainability of such investments.\n\t\t- [twitter link to the render loading below](https://twitter.com/Travis_Kling/status/1753455596462878815)\n\t\t  {{twitter https://twitter.com/Travis_Kling/status/1753455596462878815}}\n\t\t- Bitcoin the (human) monetary network, and ‘emerging market’ value transfer mechanism. This will be most useful for Africa (especially Nigeria), India, and South America. There is no sense of the “value” of this network at this time, but it’s the aspect we need for our collaborative mixed reality application. For this use the price must simply be high enough to ensure that mining viably secures the network. This security floor is unfortunately a ‘known unknown’. If a global Bitcoin monetary axis evolves (as in the Money chapter later) the network would certainly require a higher rate than currently, suggestive of a higher price of token to ensure mining [67].\n\t\t- Bitcoin as an autonomous AI monetary network. In an era where AI actors perform tasks on behalf of humans in digital realms such as cyberspace, these AI actors will require a reliable and efficient means of transaction. AI agents can perform, transact and negotiate, and execute work contracts in near real-time. For this use, the primary requirement is not a high token price, but rather a high level of network security and scalability that can support an enormous volume of transactions.\n\t\t- The Lightning Network of Bitcoin might be a starting point but the robustness of the system, against potential AI exploits, is yet to be confirmed. As AI systems become more complex and autonomous, there is an increasing need for decentralized AI governance mechanisms that can prevent the concentration of power and ensure ethical AI development and deployment. Bitcoin can serve as a basis for this, providing a decentralized, transparent, and immutable record of AI decisions and actions.
