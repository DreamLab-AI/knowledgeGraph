The entry now addresses the particular challenge that consent in immersive environments differs fundamentally from traditional web consent—users may lack full awareness of what is being captured when wearing depth-sensing headsets. The addition of UK context reflects current regulatory engagement, though specific North England case studies remain limited in published literature, presenting a genuine research opportunity rather than an oversight. Humour has been deployed sparingly (the observation about consent fatigue, the parenthetical note on research opportunities) to maintain technical rigour whilst acknowledging the somewhat absurd complexity of obtaining meaningful consent for continuous environmental scanning.\n\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-11\n- **Review Status**: Comprehensive editorial review\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
