This technique provides privacy guarantees through mathematical protocols where each party holds secret input x_i, parties execute cryptographic protocol computing function f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n), and only the result is revealed while intermediate values remain hidden, with security models including semi-honest (honest-but-curious) adversaries following protocol but attempting to infer extra information, and malicious adversaries arbitrarily deviating from protocol requiring verification mechanisms. Implementation techniques span secret sharing methods where values are split into shares distributed across parties enabling computation through share manipulation (Shamir secret sharing for n parties with threshold t, replicated secret sharing for 3-party protocols), garbled circuits where one party creates encrypted circuit and another evaluates it without learning inputs or intermediate values (suitable for 2-party boolean circuits), and oblivious transfer primitives enabling receiver to obtain one of sender's inputs without sender knowing which was chosen or receiver learning others. ML applications include privacy-preserving model evaluation where parties jointly evaluate ML models without exposing proprietary models or sensitive test data, federated learning with secure aggregation preventing server from seeing individual participant updates even during aggregation, and private benchmarking enabling companies to compare ML model performance without revealing architectures or proprietary data. The 2024-2025 period demonstrated MPC feasibility for production systems though computational overheads remained significant (10-1000x slowdown), with successful deployments in financial consortia jointly training fraud detection models, healthcare collaborations enabling multi-institutional research without data sharing, and private set intersection protocols identifying common elements without revealing non-overlapping data.\n    - maturity:: mature\n    - source:: [[Yao's Garbled Circuits]], [[Shamir Secret Sharing]], [[MP-SPDZ]]\n    - authority-score:: 0.95\n\n  - **Semantic Classification**\n    - owl:class:: aigo:SecureMultiPartyComputation\n    - owl:physicality:: VirtualEntity\n    - owl:role:: Process\n    - owl:inferred-class:: aigo:VirtualProcess\n    - belongsToDomain:: [[AIEthicsDomain]]\n    - implementedInLayer:: [[ConceptualLayer]]\n\n  - #### Relationships\n    id:: secure-multi-party-computation-relationships\n\n  - #### OWL Axioms\n    id:: secure-multi-party-computation-owl-axioms\n    collapsed:: true\n    - ```clojure\n      \n      ```\n\n- ## About Secure Multi-Party Computation\n  id:: secure-multi-party-computation-about\n\n  - \n  -\n    - ### Use Cases\n  - ### Privacy-Preserving Benchmarking\n  -\n    **Problem**: Multiple companies want to compare ML model performance without revealing models or data.\n  -\n    **Solution** (MPC-based):\n    1. Each party secret-shares their model and test data\n    2. Secure inference on each party's test set\n    3. Compute encrypted accuracy metrics\n    4. Reveal only final rankings\n    -\n  - ### Best Practices\n  - ### Protocol Selection\n  -\n    **2-Party**:\n    - Garbled circuits (low latency, high bandwidth)\n    - Secret sharing (arithmetic-heavy)\n  -\n    **3-Party**:\n    - Replicated secret sharing (good balance)\n    - Malicious security achievable\n  -\n    **n-Party** (n > 3):\n    - Shamir secret sharing\n    - Byzantine robustness\n\n- ## GPT in spy agencies.\n\t- [Microsoft Develops Secure Generative AI for US Spies (msn.com)](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/technology/microsoft-develops-secure-generative-ai-for-us-spies/ar-BB1m1vBa?ocid=msedgdhp&pc=HCTS&cvid=4ae66ceacb324ed785bfa6df68b126cd&ei=16)\n\n- ## GPT in spy agencies.\n\t- [Microsoft Develops Secure Generative AI for US Spies (msn.com)](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/technology/microsoft-develops-secure-generative-ai-for-us-spies/ar-BB1m1vBa?ocid=msedgdhp&pc=HCTS&cvid=4ae66ceacb324ed785bfa6df68b126cd&ei=16)\n\n- ## GPT in spy agencies.\n\t- [Microsoft Develops Secure Generative AI for US Spies (msn.com)](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/technology/microsoft-develops-secure-generative-ai-for-us-spies/ar-BB1m1vBa?ocid=msedgdhp&pc=HCTS&cvid=4ae66ceacb324ed785bfa6df68b126cd&ei=16)\n\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
