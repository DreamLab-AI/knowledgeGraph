These systems encompass cryptographic hash functions for data integrity verification, digital signature schemes for authentication and authorization, encryption mechanisms for confidentiality, and advanced protocols like zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving verification. Blockchain cryptographic systems must satisfy rigorous security requirements including collision resistance for hash functions, computational infeasibility of private key recovery from public keys, and resistance to quantum computing attacks in next-generation systems.
