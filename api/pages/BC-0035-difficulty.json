Made by Kevin Van Witt and the talented team at The Monster Library https://t.co/IXLWO1Be91\" / X (twitter.com)](https://twitter.com/ProfKeeting/status/1801632319536607623)\n\t- {{twitter https://twitter.com/ProfKeeting/status/1801632319536607623}}\n- {{embed ((661d5f76-bd9c-493d-afc1-efcec299ed24))}}\n- {{embed ((664465de-5bd3-4169-a90b-c03f117bef04))}}\n\n\t\t- ## Difficulty adjustment\n\t - The difficult adjustment (also mentioned earlier) shifts the difficultyof the mining algorithm globally to re-target one new block every 10minutes. This means that adding a glut of new mining equipment willincrease the issuance of Bitcoins, in favour of the new mining entity,for up to 2 weeks, at which point the difficulty increases, the scheduleresets, and the advantage to the new miner is diffused. Equally thisprotects the network against significant loss of global mining hashrate,as happened when China comprehensively banned mining. Again, this isexplained in [more detail](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty)elsewhere.\n\n\t- ### Comparative Analysis\n\t- **Scope of Comparison**: The article notes the difficulty in making direct comparisons due to the different scopes and impact areas of each industry.\n\t- **Relative Impact**: Bitcoin's consumption and emissions are less than half of the gold mining industry and less than one-fifth of the banking sector.\n\t- **Energy Use vs Pollution**: The article distinguishes between energy use and pollution, emphasizing the importance of considering both aspects in environmental impact assessments.\n\n\t\t- ## Stable Diffusion 1.5, XL, and 3\n\t\t\t- UK company with global impact. It is likely now winding up it's operations after difficulty generating revenue in the hyper competitive GenAI market.\n\t\t\t\t- **Introduction**: Open-source model by StabilityAI\n\t\t\t\t\t- **Cost**: Free to run on own hardware; nominal fee for online tools.\n\t\t\t\t\t- **User Interface**: User-friendly through platforms like Leonardo.AI.\n\t\t\t\t\t- **Strengths**: Unlimited control, good image quality, no censorship.\n\t\t\t\t\t- **Weaknesses**: Requires decent hardware, steep learning curve. Questions about Stability business.\n\t\t\t\t\t- **Skill Level**: Intermediate to advanced.\n\n\t- ## Image, Video and 3D\n\t\t- [[Stable Diffusion]] and [[Stable Video Diffusion]] allow a lot of control, but at a cost of complexity.\n\t\t\t- UK company with global impact. It is likely now winding up it's operations after difficulty generating revenue in the hyper competitive GenAI market.\n\t\t\t\t- **Introduction**: Open-source model by StabilityAI\n\t\t\t\t\t- **Weaknesses**: Requires decent hardware, steep learning curve.
