(2024). \"Status Report on the Third Round of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process.\" NIST Interagency Report 8413.\n\n  - ### Fifth Algorithm Selected (March 2025) [Updated 2025]\n    - On 11th March 2025, [[NIST]] selected **[[HQC]] (Hamming Quasi-Cyclic)** as the fifth algorithm for post-quantum encryption\n    - HQC was chosen specifically as a backup standard based on different mathematical foundations than ML-KEM, providing cryptographic diversity against potential mathematical breakthroughs\n    - Based on [[Code-Based Cryptography]], offering an alternative to lattice-based approaches\n    - Following a 90-day comment period, NIST planned to finalise the standard for release in 2027\n\n  - ### Transition Guidance and Fourth Round [Updated 2025]\n    - NIST published draft guidance in November 2024 describing expected approaches to transitioning from quantum-vulnerable cryptographic algorithms to post-quantum alternatives\n    - By October 2024, NIST down-selected to **15 second-round signature candidates** for further analysis from 40 initially accepted submissions, demonstrating continued refinement of PQC capabilities\n    - Hybrid approaches combining classical and post-quantum algorithms recommended during transition period\n    - Academic citations: Moody et al. (2024). \"Transitioning Organizations to Post-Quantum Cryptography.\" NIST White Paper.\n\n  - ### Blockchain Implications [Updated 2025]\n    - Post-quantum cryptography posed existential questions for blockchain systems relying on [[ECDSA]] signatures ([[Bitcoin]], [[Ethereum]]) and [[Public-Key Cryptography]]\n    - Whilst quantum computers capable of deriving private keys from public keys remained theoretical, the **\"Q-Day\" threat**—when quantum computers could break current cryptography—required proactive migration strategies\n    - [[Bitcoin]]'s cryptographic community, including [[Pieter Wuille]], [[Gregory Maxwell]], [[Andrew Poelstra]], and [[Jonas Nick]], began exploring quantum-resistant signature schemes whilst preserving backwards compatibility\n    - Bitcoin's core cryptographic protocols ([[ECDSA]] on secp256k1, SHA-256, RIPEMD-160) had withstood scrutiny since 2009 despite enormous financial incentives for breaking them, demonstrating security through time-testing\n    - However, the quantum threat represented a qualitatively different challenge requiring algorithmic replacement rather than parameter tuning\n    - The cryptographic transition required coordinated ecosystem-wide upgrades: [[Wallets]], [[Exchanges]], [[Nodes]], and protocols all needed quantum-resistant signature verification\n    - The complexity of this migration—potentially the largest coordinated cryptographic upgrade in history—underscored the importance of NIST's standards and ongoing academic research\n    - Academic citations: Fernández-Caramés & Fraga-Lamas (2020). \"Towards Post-Quantum Blockchain: A Review on Blockchain Cryptography Resistant to Quantum Computing Attacks.\" IEEE Access, 8, 21091-21116.\n\n- ## The Cypherpunk Movement and Cryptography History\n  id:: cryptography-cypherpunk-history\n\n  - ### A Cypherpunk's Manifesto (1993)\n    id:: cryptography-cypherpunk-manifesto\n\n    - **[[A Cypherpunk's Manifesto]]** by [[Eric Hughes]], published on 9 March 1993, is a foundational text for the [[Cypherpunk Movement]], articulating the necessity of [[Privacy]] in the digital age and advocating for the use of [[Cryptography]] and [[Anonymous Systems]] to protect individual freedoms.\n\n    - **Significance in Cryptography History**\n      - The manifesto is considered the \"holy text\" of the cypherpunk movement, which emerged from discussions among [[Eric Hughes]], [[Timothy C. May]], and [[John Gilmore]] in the early 1990s\n      - It builds on earlier work by [[David Chaum]], notably his research on anonymous digital cash and pseudonymous reputation systems, which laid the groundwork for privacy-preserving technologies\n      - The manifesto catalyzed the development and advocacy of privacy-enhancing technologies, influencing the trajectory of modern cryptography and digital rights activism\n      - Full text: [A Cypherpunk's Manifesto](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html) - \"Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy.\"\n\n    - **Key Principles**\n      - **Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age**\n        - Hughes distinguishes between *privacy* and *secrecy*: privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself, while secrecy is about hiding information from everyone\n      - **Self-defense of privacy**\n        - The manifesto asserts that individuals cannot rely on governments or corporations to grant privacy; instead, they must defend it themselves\n        - \"We must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any. We must come together and create systems which allow anonymous transactions to take place.\"\n      - **Cypherpunks write code**\n        - The movement's motto emphasizes practical action: writing and publishing software to enable privacy, rather than relying on policy or regulation\n        - \"We know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do, we're going to write it.\"\n      - **Creation of anonymous transaction systems**\n        - Hughes calls for systems that allow for anonymous transactions, leveraging cryptographic tools like [[Digital Signatures]] and [[Anonymous Remailers]] to protect user identities\n        - \"Privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction systems. Until now, cash has been the primary such system.\"\n      - **Opposition to regulation of cryptography**\n        - The manifesto opposes restrictions on cryptographic tools, arguing that encryption is a private act and essential for defending privacy\n        - \"Cypherpunks deplore regulations on cryptography, for encryption is fundamentally a private act.\"\n\n    - **Influence on Cryptocurrency Development**\n      - The manifesto's call for anonymous transaction systems directly inspired the development of digital cash and cryptocurrencies, including [[Bitcoin]]\n      - Concepts such as *security without identification* and *electronic money* trace their roots to cypherpunk discussions and Hughes' advocacy\n      - The ethos of \"Cypherpunks write code\" led to the creation of practical privacy tools, including [[Anonymous Remailers]], [[Tor]], and privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like [[Monero]] and [[Zcash]]\n      - The manifesto's insistence on decentralization and resistance to censorship are core principles in the design of blockchain-based systems\n\n  - ### Eric Hughes: Cypherpunk Founder\n    id:: cryptography-eric-hughes\n\n    -

**Anonymous Remailer**\n        - Created and hosted the first [[Anonymous Remailer]] (Type I), a system that allowed users to send emails without revealing their identity\n        - Collaborated with [[Hal Finney]] on this project in 1992\n        - Contributed technical improvements to remailer protocols, including padding and mixing messages to counter [[Traffic Analysis]]\n      - **Key Phrases**\n        - Coined \"Cypherpunks write code,\" encapsulating the movement's ethos of building practical privacy solutions\n        - Also originated \"All cryptography is economics,\" highlighting the interplay between technical and social systems\n\n    - **Influence on [[Bitcoin]] and Cryptocurrency**\n      - The Cypherpunk mailing list, administered by Hughes, was the environment where foundational ideas for [[Bitcoin]] and other cryptocurrencies were discussed and refined\n      - His advocacy for cryptographic privacy and decentralized systems influenced the design principles behind Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem\n      - Notable cypherpunks who contributed to Bitcoin's development include [[Hal Finney]] (first Bitcoin recipient), [[Nick Szabo]] ([[Bit Gold]] creator), [[Wei Dai]] ([[b-money]] creator), and [[Adam Back]] ([[Hashcash]] creator)\n\n- ## Leading Cryptographers in Blockchain Development\n  id:: cryptography-key-researchers\n\n  -

Identified vulnerabilities in [[Lightning Network]] including replacement cycling attacks\n      - Publications at Financial Cryptography, ACM CCS\n\n- ## Lightning Network Security Research [Updated 2025]\n  id:: cryptography-lightning-security\n\n  - ### Replacement Cycling Vulnerability (2023-2024)\n    - The [[Lightning Network]] faced a critical vulnerability known as the **replacement cycling attack**, with significant implications for [[Cryptographic Vulnerabilities]] in Layer 2 protocols\n\n    - **Nature of the Vulnerability**\n      - The vulnerability, disclosed by developer [[Antoine Riard]] in October 2023, allows for **replacement cycling attacks** (also called \"transaction relay jamming attacks\") that exploit the way Lightning channels use [[Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs)]] and Bitcoin's transaction replacement logic\n      - Attackers can **jam or replace legitimate HTLC transactions** with a cycle of spam transactions, potentially freezing or stealing funds by preventing honest transactions from being confirmed on the Bitcoin base layer\n      - The attack leverages Bitcoin's [[Mempool]] behavior, where transactions can be replaced if they offer a higher fee, and exploits the fact that Lightning relies on timely confirmation of certain transactions to ensure funds are not lost\n      - Reference: [Bitcoin-dev mailing list discussion](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-October/021999.html)\n\n    - **Cryptographic Security Implications**\n      - The attack undermines the **atomicity and security guarantees** of [[HTLCs]], which are supposed to ensure that payments are either completed or refunded without loss\n      - By manipulating transaction propagation and replacement, attackers can **bypass the intended cryptographic guarantees**, leading to potential loss of funds or indefinite locking of funds in channels\n      - The vulnerability is not a flaw in the underlying cryptographic primitives (like [[Hash Functions]] or [[Time Locks]]), but rather in the **protocol-level assumptions about transaction relay and confirmation** on the Bitcoin network\n      - This highlights the importance of considering [[Transaction Relay]] and [[Mempool]] dynamics in [[Layer 2 Security]]\n\n    - **Scope and Impact**\n      - The vulnerability primarily affects **forwarding nodes**—those that route payments between other users—making them susceptible to having their funds stolen or locked\n      - No major thefts have been reported, but the attack requires significant technical sophistication, including deep knowledge of Bitcoin's mempool and transaction structure\n      - Large institutions and private Lightning channels may be at greater risk due to the scale of funds involved and the complexity of their setups\n\n    - **Mitigations and Community Response**\n      - All major Lightning implementations ([[LDK]], [[Eclair]], [[LND]], [[Core-Lightning]]) have issued **patches and mitigations** to address the most immediate attack vectors\n      - These mitigations include changes to transaction rebroadcasting and fee bumping strategies, but **do not fully eliminate the underlying protocol risk**\n      - Some developers, including [[Matt Corallo]], have expressed concern that current mitigations are insufficient and that a **fundamental fix may require changes at the Bitcoin base layer**, such as new consensus rules or more memory-intensive transaction tracking\n      - The incident has sparked debate within the [[Bitcoin]] and [[Lightning Network]] communities about the long-term security model of Lightning and the need for ongoing vigilance and protocol evolution\n\n    - **Academic Context**\n      - The vulnerability exposes a gap between cryptographic protocol design and real-world network behavior\n      - Demonstrates that even well-designed cryptographic protocols can have vulnerabilities at the system integration level\n      - Ongoing research at conferences like [[Financial Cryptography]], [[IEEE S&P]], and [[Real World Crypto]] continues to analyze and improve Layer 2 security\n\n- ## Academic Publication Venues for Cryptography Research\n  id:: cryptography-publication-venues\n\n  -
