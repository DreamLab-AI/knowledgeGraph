This framework defines roles and responsibilities across the AI lifecycle, implements risk management processes, ensures regulatory compliance, and establishes decision-making authority for AI-related activities. Key components include executive leadership commitment and sponsorship, cross-functional governance committees or AI ethics boards, documented policies covering AI development standards, risk assessment procedures, ethical guidelines, and data governance protocols, incident response and escalation procedures, compliance monitoring and audit mechanisms, and continuous improvement processes. An effective AI governance framework integrates with existing organizational governance structures (IT governance, data governance, enterprise risk management) while addressing AI-specific concerns including algorithmic accountability, fairness and bias mitigation, transparency and explainability requirements, human oversight provisions, and stakeholder engagement. Implementation aligns with international standards including ISO/IEC 42001:2023 AI Management Systems, OECD AI Principles, EU AI Act governance requirements, and sector-specific regulations, providing a systematic approach to managing AI risks and ensuring trustworthy AI deployment that protects organizational interests and stakeholder rights.\n    - maturity:: mature\n    - source:: [[ISO/IEC 42001:2023]], [[OECD AI Principles]], [[EU AI Act]]\n    - authority-score:: 0.95\n\n  - **Semantic Classification**\n    - owl:class:: aigo:AIGovernanceFramework\n    - owl:physicality:: VirtualEntity\n    - owl:role:: Process\n    - owl:inferred-class:: aigo:VirtualProcess\n    - belongsToDomain:: [[AIEthicsDomain]]\n    - implementedInLayer:: [[ConceptualLayer]]\n\n  - #### Relationships\n    id:: 0387-ai-governance-framework-relationships\n\n  - #### OWL Axioms\n    id:: 0387-ai-governance-framework-owl-axioms\n    collapsed:: true\n    - ```clojure\n      (Declaration (Class :AIGovernanceFramework))\n(SubClassOf :AIGovernanceFramework :OrganisationalGovernance)\n\n(SubClassOf :AIGovernanceFramework\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :establishes :OversightMechanism))\n(SubClassOf :AIGovernanceFramework\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :implements :EthicalPrinciples))\n(SubClassOf :AIGovernanceFramework\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :ensures :Accountability))\n(SubClassOf :AIGovernanceFramework\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :defines :RolesAndResponsibilities))\n(SubClassOf :AIGovernanceFramework\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :includes :PolicyFramework))\n(SubClassOf :AIGovernanceFramework\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :manages :AIRisk))\n\n(DisjointWith :AIGovernanceFramework :DataGovernanceFramework)\n(DisjointWith :AIGovernanceFramework :ITGovernanceFramework)\n      ```\n\n- ## About 0387 Ai Governance Framework\n  id:: 0387-ai-governance-framework-about\n\n  - \n  -\n  \n\n- # Proposed Layered Framework\n\n- # Agentic Mycelia: A Framework for a Decentralized Metaverse\n-\n\n- # Introduction\n\t- This document explores the concept of the \"Agentic Mycelia,\" a framework for interconnected metaverse instances operating within a decentralized and AI-driven ecosystem.\n\n\t- #### Liquid tokens\n\t\t- We have seen that Liquid from Blockstream is a comparatively mature andbattle tested sidechain framework, based upon Bitcoin.
