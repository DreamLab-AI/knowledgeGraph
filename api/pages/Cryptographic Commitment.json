(2025). \"Commitment Schemes from One-Way Functions with Applications to Quantum Cryptography.\" *Entropy*, 27(7), 751. DOI: 10.3390/e27070751.\n- These works explore foundational constructions, efficiency improvements, and quantum-resistant schemes.\n- Ongoing research focuses on:\n  - Enhancing efficiency in quantum oblivious transfer protocols.\n  - Developing interactive string commitment schemes with preprocessing.\n  - Formalising security proofs under realistic adversarial models, including malicious participants.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK has a strong tradition in cryptographic research, with institutions such as the University of Manchester and University of Leeds contributing to commitment scheme theory and applications.\n- North England innovation hubs actively explore secure computation and privacy technologies, often collaborating with industry partners in fintech and health tech sectors.\n- Regional case studies include:\n  - Deployment of commitment-based protocols in Manchester’s smart city initiatives for secure data sharing.\n  - Leeds-based startups integrating commitment schemes into blockchain identity verification platforms.\n- The UK government’s NCSC promotes adoption of cryptographic best practices, including commitment schemes, to enhance national cybersecurity resilience.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends:\n  - Integration of commitment schemes with post-quantum cryptographic primitives.\n  - Increased use in decentralised finance (DeFi) and secure multi-party computation for privacy-preserving analytics.\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Balancing efficiency with strong security guarantees in resource-constrained environments.\n  - Addressing scalability issues in large-scale distributed systems.\n- Research priorities:\n  - Designing commitment schemes with minimal communication overhead.\n  - Formal verification of protocols incorporating commitments under complex adversarial models.\n  - Exploring novel applications in UK-specific regulatory and industrial contexts.\n\n## References\n\n1.
