2014: SRCNN - First [[Convolutional Neural Network]] for super-resolution (Dong et al.)\n  - 2016: VDSR and DRCN - Very deep networks with residual learning\n  - 2017: EDSR wins NTIRE challenge with enhanced deep residual networks\n  - 2017: SRGAN - First [[GAN]]-based perceptual super-resolution (Ledig et al.)\n  - 2018: ESRGAN - Enhanced version with improved [[Generator]] architecture\n  - 2020: Real-ESRGAN - Practical degradation model for real-world images\n  - 2021: SwinIR - [[Transformer]]-based super-resolution architecture\n  - 2023: StableSR - [[Stable Diffusion]]-based upscaling emerges\n  - 2024: SUPIR and CCSR - Current SOTA using [[Latent Diffusion Model]]\n\n- The transition from [[GAN]]-based to [[Diffusion Model]]-based upscaling [Updated 2025] represents a paradigm shift, with diffusion models providing better texture generation and fewer artifacts at the cost of computational complexity\n\n- ## Mathematical Foundations\n\n- ### Super-Resolution Problem Formulation\n\n- The classical super-resolution inverse problem models low-resolution (LR) image generation as:\n  - **Degradation Model**: `y = (x ⊗ k) ↓s + n`\n    - `y` = low-resolution observed image\n    - `x` = high-resolution ground truth\n    - `k` = blur kernel (often Gaussian)\n    - `⊗` = convolution operation\n    - `↓s` = downsampling by factor `s` (e.g., 2x, 4x)\n    - `n` = additive noise (typically Gaussian)\n\n- The goal is to recover `x̂` (estimated high-resolution image) from `y` by learning inverse mapping `f: y → x̂` using [[Deep Learning]]\n\n- ### Image Quality Metrics\n\n- **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**:\n  - `PSNR = 10 · log₁₀(MAX²/MSE)`\n  - `MSE = (1/N) Σ(x - x̂)²`\n  - Measured in dB; higher is better\n  - Standard metric but correlates poorly with perceptual quality\n  - Typical SOTA: 28-32 dB for 4x upscaling on benchmark datasets\n\n- **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**:\n  - `SSIM(x,y) = [l(x,y)]^α · [c(x,y)]^β · [s(x,y)]^γ`\n  - Compares luminance, contrast, and structure\n  - Range [0,1]; higher is better\n  - Better perceptual correlation than PSNR\n  - SOTA models achieve 0.85-0.92 SSIM on DIV2K\n\n- **LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity)**:\n  - Uses pre-trained [[VGG]] or [[AlexNet]] features\n  - `LPIPS = Σ ||φ_l(x) - φ_l(x̂)||²`\n  - Lower is better (measures perceptual distance)\n  - Best metric for [[GAN]] and diffusion-based methods\n  - Modern models: 0.05-0.15 LPIPS scores\n\n- ### Loss Functions\n\n- **Pixel Loss (L1/L2)**:\n  - L1: `L_pixel = |x - x̂|`\n  - L2: `L_pixel = ||x - x̂||²`\n  - Optimizes for PSNR but produces smooth, blurry results\n  - Used in early methods (SRCNN, VDSR, EDSR)\n\n- **Perceptual Loss**:\n  - `L_perceptual = Σ_l ||φ_l(x) - φ_l(x̂)||²`\n  - Uses [[VGG19]] features from multiple layers\n  - Preserves high-level semantic content\n  - Critical for [[GAN]]-based methods (SRGAN, ESRGAN)\n\n- **Adversarial Loss** (for [[GAN]]-based upscaling):\n  - `L_adv = E[log D(x)] + E[log(1 - D(G(y)))]`\n  - Discriminator `D` distinguishes real vs. generated HR images\n  - Generator `G` produces HR images to fool discriminator\n  - Enables photorealistic texture synthesis\n  - RaGAN (Relativistic GAN) used in ESRGAN improves stability\n\n- **Diffusion Loss** (for [[Stable Diffusion]] upscaling):\n  - `L_diffusion = E_t[||ε - ε_θ(z_t, t, c)||²]`\n  - Predicts noise `ε` at timestep `t`\n  - Conditioned on LR image `c` and latent `z_t`\n  - SUPIR uses this with [[SDXL]] backbone\n\n- ## Classical Super-Resolution Methods\n\n- ### Traditional Interpolation\n\n- **Bicubic Interpolation**:\n  - Polynomial interpolation using 4x4 pixel neighborhood\n  - Standard baseline for super-resolution benchmarks\n  - Fast (real-time) but produces blurry edges\n  - Available in all image editing software and [[OpenCV]]\n  - PSNR: ~24-26 dB for 4x upscaling\n\n- **Lanczos Resampling**:\n  - Sinc-based kernel with windowing function\n  - Better edge preservation than bicubic\n  - Used in professional software ([[Photoshop]], [[GIMP]])\n  - Computational cost 2-3x bicubic\n  - Still limited by lack of semantic understanding\n\n- ### Deep Learning Classical Methods\n\n- **EDSR (Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution)**:\n  - 2017 NTIRE challenge winner\n  -
