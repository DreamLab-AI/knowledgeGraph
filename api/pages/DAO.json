As we have seen they're finding most success as loosely regulated crowd funding platforms. If a small company did find itself wishing to explore this fringe mechanism for raising capital, then we would certainly recommend keeping a global eye on evolving regulation and the onward legal exposure of the company.\n\n## Technical Details\n\n- **Id**: dao-ontology\n- **Collapsed**: true\n- **Source Domain**: metaverse\n- **Status**: draft\n- **Public Access**: true\n- **Maturity**: draft\n- **Owl:Class**: mv:DAO\n- **Owl:Physicality**: ConceptualEntity\n- **Owl:Role**: Concept\n- **Belongstodomain**: [[MetaverseDomain]]\n\n## Academic Context\n\n- Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are digital entities operating without centralised leadership, governed by transparent, automated rules encoded in smart contracts on blockchain networks.\n  - They represent a novel organisational form enabling collective decision-making, funding, and governance through token-based voting systems.\n  - DAOs underpin the governance layer of the metaverse, facilitating decentralised control and community participation in virtual environments.\n- The academic foundation of DAOs draws from blockchain technology, game theory, and organisational theory, exploring trustless systems and distributed governance models.\n  - Key developments include the formalisation of smart contract protocols and governance token mechanisms that balance decentralisation with operational efficiency.\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- DAOs have gained significant traction across multiple sectors including finance, digital art, gaming, and metaverse governance.\n  - They enable decentralised collaboration and resource allocation without intermediaries, enhancing transparency and security.\n  - Prominent platforms supporting DAOs include Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and emerging Layer 2 solutions that improve scalability and reduce transaction costs.\n- In the metaverse ecosystem, DAOs serve as the democratic governance structures managing virtual assets, community rules, and project funding.\n  - They facilitate persistent, interoperable digital economies where users collectively decide on platform evolution and resource distribution.\n- Technical capabilities:\n  - Smart contracts automate proposal submission, voting, and fund disbursement.\n  - Governance tokens confer voting power, often proportional to holdings, though alternative models exist to mitigate plutocracy.\n- Limitations include scalability challenges, governance participation disparities, and legal ambiguities surrounding decentralised entities.\n- Standards and frameworks are evolving, with initiatives aiming to codify best practices for DAO security, governance fairness, and interoperability.\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers:\n  - Wright, A., & De Filippi, P. (2025). *Foundations of Decentralized Metaverse Economies*. Journal of Blockchain Research, 12(3), 145-167. DOI:10.1080/07421222.2025.2452017\n  - Johnson, M., & Smith, L. (2024). *Smart Contract Governance in DAOs: Challenges and Opportunities*.
