Token holders have voting rights proportional to their holding. The first decentalised autonomous organisation was simply called \"The DAO\" and was launched on the Ethereum network in 2016 after raising around \\$100M. [It quickly succumbed to a hack and the money was drained](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao#section-what-is-a-dao). This event was an important moment in the development of Ethereum and resulted in a code fork which preserves two separate versions of the network to this day, though one is falling into obsolescence. Again, this is covered in Shin's book on the period in extreme detail, but it seems this stuff is falling into dusty history now, leaving only a somewhat tarnished and technically shaky legacy \\[[31](https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx31)\\].\\ In practice DAOs have very few committed 'stakeholders' and the same names seem to crop up across multiple projects. Some crucial community decisions within large projects only poll a couple of dozen eligible participants. Its might be that the experiment of distributed governance is failing at this stage.\nPerhaps more interesting is the use of the DAO concept to crowd fund global projects, currently especially for the acquisition of important art or cultural items. DAOs are also emerging as a way to fund promising technology projects, though this is reminiscent of the 2017 ICO craze which ended badly and is likely to [fall foul of regulations](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8590-22).\nWithin the NFT and digital art space PleaserDAO has quickly established a strong following. \"PleasrDAO is a collective of DeFi leaders, early NFT collectors and digital artists who have built a formidable yet benevolent reputation for acquiring culturally significant pieces with a charitable twist.\nOpensea wrangle between IPO and governance token.\nConstitutionDAO, Once upon a time in Shaolin etc\n- ##### Problems experienced to date\n  DAOs exist in a gray area with unclear legal recognition, leading to challenges in fitting into existing legal frameworks and regulatory systems. This lack of clarity raises concerns about how DAOs can comply with laws and regulations, potentially leading to legal disputes or conflicts with regulatory authorities. Security Risks and Technological Vulnerabilities:\n  Given their reliance on blockchain technology and smart contracts, DAOs are vulnerable to cyber threats, such as hacking and exploitation of code weaknesses. The decentralized nature of DAOs can further complicate security management and responses to breaches, raising concerns about the safety of assets and data managed by DAOs. Governance Inefficiencies and Democratic Deficiencies:\n  The non-hierarchical structure of DAOs, while innovative, may lead to governance challenges, including potential inefficiencies in decision-making processes. There's also a risk of DAOs deviating from democratic principles, possibly leading to control by a limited group of technologically adept individuals (technocracy) or oligarchic tendencies, which could marginalize participants who are less tech-savvy. Fragmentation and Complexity in Governance Models:\n  The existence of multiple, simultaneous governance models within DAOs can lead to fragmentation, resulting in a lack of coherent and unified governance. This complexity can create confusion among participants and hinder effective decision-making, posing challenges to the democratic functioning and overall effectiveness of DAOs.\n- #### 5.5.1 DAOs on Bitcoin\n- ##### Bisq DAO\n  One of the better designed DAOs is [Bisq DAO](https://bisq.network/dao/). It's slightly different design trys to address the issue of overly rigid software intersecting with more intangible and fluid human governance needs. From their website:\n  [\"Revenue distribution and decision-making cannot be decentralized with traditional organization structures they require legal entities, jurisdictions, bank accounts, and more---all of which are central points of failure. The Bisq DAO replaces such legacy infrastructure with cryptographic infrastructure to handle project decision-making and revenue distribution without such central points of failure.\"]\n- ##### Stackerstan\n  Stackerstan is a layer two protocol that operates on top of the Bitcoin and Nostr protocols. It aims to provide a decentralized and efficient platform for people to collaborate and build valuable products and services, without the need for agreement on what to build or how to build it, in a fully decentralised way.\n  Github contributor GazHayes [has a writeup](https://github.com/Stackerstan/interfarce/issues/20#issuecomment-1369329734) which is paraphrased below, explaining this very new and emergent technology stack.\n  The Stackerstan protocol is designed to be infinitely scalable, due to the absence of \"organizational mutexes\".\n  Stackerstan was anonymously posted in the Nostr telegram group at the end of 2022 and is a new project that aims to offer a more efficient and decentralized way of solving problems compared to existing companies, institutions, and decentralized organizations. It utilizes a combination of existing technologies, protocols, and concepts to create a system that allows people to spontaneously organize into highly efficient and intelligent groups. The platform is designed to be fair to everyone involved and is completely non-custodial, meaning that it doesn't require a shared pot of money or any funding.\n    Anyone can become a participant in Stackerstan by being added by an     existing participant, creating a tree of participants that can be     severed if a bad actor is present.     Work is done within Stackerstan by continuously identifying problems     and applying the simplest possible solution to these problems,     expanding the scope of what Stackerstan can do.     Any participant can log a problem and claim it to solve it, and the     scope of what can become a problem to solve is not limited.     Shares are created by a participant filing an expense to indicate     the relative value of their work, which is a request to be repaid     when Stackerstan generates revenue.     Shares are approved expenses, and the only way for new shares to be     created is by approving expenses for work done to solve problems.     Participants with shares can vote to approve or reject new expenses,     and there are rules to follow when voting on expenses.     Stackerstan was created at block 761151 and has a single share to     bootstrap the process, with a small number of shares created by     approved expenses so far.     Shareholders own all revenue generated by Stackerstan's products and     services, and revenue is distributed through two algorithms: first,     paying back expenses in the order they were filed, and second,     streaming dividends to whoever has received the least dividends per     share owned.     Stackerstan is non-custodial and does not require a shared pot of     money, making it more effective and avoiding toxic situations.     Voting on things like approving expenses is done with votepower,     which quantifies a participant's skin in the game.     Lead time is a measure of a participant's votepower and can be     increased or decreased by one unit every 2016 blocks.     A participant's shares can only be transferred if their lead time is     0, and a participant can reduce their lead time to sell their     shares.\n- ##### Mindmachine\n  The Mindmachine is a stateful Nostr client written in Go. This text is directly quoted from the [GazHayes github](https://github.com/gazhayes/mindmachine).\n    Participants interact with the Mindmachine using Nostr Events. The     Mindmachine subscribes to all Nostr event Kinds that it can handle,     and attempts to update its state by processing them based on the     rules in the Stackerstan Superprotocol.     If an Event successfully triggers the Mindmachine to change state,     the Event ID is appended to a Kind 640001 Nostr Event which the     Mindmachine publishes once per Bitcoin block.     The Mindmachine can rebuild anyone's state by subscribing to their     640001 events and replaying the list of Nostr Events contained     within.     Consensus is based on Votepower. When a Participant with Votepower     greater than 0 witnesses a new Mindmachine state, the Mindmachine     hashes the state and publishes it in a Kind 640000 Nostr Event. This     is effectively a vote for the witnessed state at a particular     Bitcoin height.     A Mindmachine state is considered stable when in excess of 50% of     total Votepower has signed the same state and there is a chain of     signatures back to the Ignition state. There are mechanisms to deal     with voters disappearing.     Participants who have a lot of Votepower will want to be able to     prove they had a certain Mind-state at a particular height. To do     so, they broadcast a Bitcoin transaction containing an OPRETURN of     the state.\n  Because of the tight integration with Nostr it seems that is we were to allocate work to open communities then this would be the way to do it.\n- ## Risks\n  The most interesting thing about DAOs is that they belong more in this money chapter than they do in blockchain. As we have seen they're finding most success as loosely regulated crowd funding platforms. If a small company did find itself wishing to explore this fringe mechanism for raising capital, then we would certainly recommend keeping a global eye on evolving regulation and the onward legal exposure of the company.\n\n\n## Academic Context\n\n- Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are digital entities operating without centralised leadership, governed by transparent, automated rules encoded in smart contracts on blockchain networks.\n  - They represent a novel organisational form enabling collective decision-making, funding, and governance through token-based voting systems.\n  - DAOs underpin the governance layer of the metaverse, facilitating decentralised control and community participation in virtual environments.\n- The academic foundation of DAOs draws from blockchain technology, game theory, and organisational theory, exploring trustless systems and distributed governance models.\n  - Key developments include the formalisation of smart contract protocols and governance token mechanisms that balance decentralisation with operational efficiency.\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- DAOs have gained significant traction across multiple sectors including finance, digital art, gaming, and metaverse governance.\n  - They enable decentralised collaboration and resource allocation without intermediaries, enhancing transparency and security.\n  - Prominent platforms supporting DAOs include Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and emerging Layer 2 solutions that improve scalability and reduce transaction costs.\n- In the metaverse ecosystem, DAOs serve as the democratic governance structures managing virtual assets, community rules, and project funding.\n  - They facilitate persistent, interoperable digital economies where users collectively decide on platform evolution and resource distribution.\n- Technical capabilities:\n  - Smart contracts automate proposal submission, voting, and fund disbursement.\n  - Governance tokens confer voting power, often proportional to holdings, though alternative models exist to mitigate plutocracy.\n- Limitations include scalability challenges, governance participation disparities, and legal ambiguities surrounding decentralised entities.\n- Standards and frameworks are evolving, with initiatives aiming to codify best practices for DAO security, governance fairness, and interoperability.\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers:\n  - Wright, A., & De Filippi, P.
