Refer to Supported Models to find all the models offered.  \n\t  - messages\n\t    object[]  \n\t    required  \n\t    A list of messages comprising the conversation so far.  \n\t  - Show child attributes\n\t  - max_tokens\n\t    integer  \n\t    The maximum number of completion tokens returned by the API. The total number of tokens requested in max_tokens plus the number of prompt tokens sent in messages must not exceed the context window token limit of model requested. If left unspecified, then the model will generate tokens until either it reaches its stop token or the end of its context window.  \n\t  - temperature\n\t    number  \n\t    default: 0.2  \n\t    The amount of randomness in the response, valued between 0 inclusive and 2 exclusive. Higher values are more random, and lower values are more deterministic.  \n\t  - top_p\n\t    number  \n\t    default: 0.9  \n\t    The nucleus sampling threshold, valued between 0 and 1 inclusive. For each subsequent token, the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. We recommend either altering top_k or top_p, but not both.  \n\t  - return_citations\n\t    boolean  \n\t    default: false  \n\t    Determines whether or not a request to an online model should return citations. Citations are in closed beta access.  \n\t    search_domain_filter  \n\t    any[]  \n\t    Given a list of domains, limit the citations used by the online model to URLs from the specified domains. Currently limited to only 3 domains for whitelisting and blacklisting. For blacklisting add a - to the beginning of the domain string.  \n\t  - return_images\n\t    boolean  \n\t    default: false  \n\t    Determines whether or not a request to an online model should return images. Images are in closed beta access  \n\t  - return_related_questions\n\t    boolean  \n\t    default: false  \n\t    Determines whether or not a request to an online model should return related questions. Related questions are in closed beta access  \n\t    search_recency_filter  \n\t    string  \n\t    Returns search results within the specified time interval - does not apply to images. Values include month, week, day, hour.  \n\t  - top_k\n\t    number  \n\t    default: 0  \n\t    The number of tokens to keep for highest top-k filtering, specified as an integer between 0 and 2048 inclusive. If set to 0, top-k filtering is disabled. We recommend either altering top_k or top_p, but not both.  \n\t  - stream\n\t    boolean  \n\t    default: false  \n\t    Determines whether or not to incrementally stream the response with server-sent events with content-type: text/event-stream.  \n\t  - presence_penalty\n\t    number  \n\t    default: 0  \n\t    A value between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics. Incompatible with frequency_penalty.  \n\t  - frequency_penalty\n\t    number  \n\t    default: 1  \n\t    A multiplicative penalty greater than 0. Values greater than 1.0 penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim. A value of 1.0 means no penalty. Incompatible with presence_penalty.  \n\t    Response  \n\t    200 - application/json  \n\t    id  \n\t    string  \n\t    An ID generated uniquely for each response.  \n\t  - model\n\t    string  \n\t    The model used to generate the response.  \n\t  - object\n\t    string  \n\t    The object type, which always equals chat.completion.  \n\t  - created\n\t    integer  \n\t    The Unix timestamp (in seconds) of when the completion was created.  \n\t  - choices\n\t    object[]  \n\t    The list of completion choices the model generated for the input prompt.  \n\t  - Hide child attributes\n\t  - choices.index\n\t    integer  \n\t    choices.finish_reason  \n\t    enum<string>  \n\t    The reason the model stopped generating tokens. Possible values include stop if the model hit a natural stopping point, or length if the maximum number of tokens specified in the request was reached.  \n\t  - Available options: stop, length \n\t    choices.message  \n\t    object  \n\t    The message generated by the model.  \n\t  - Show child attributes\n\t  - choices.delta\n\t    object  \n\t    The incrementally streamed next tokens. Only meaningful when stream = true.  \n\t  - Show child attributes\n\t  - usage\n\t    object  \n\t    Usage statistics for the completion request.  \n\t  - Hide child attributes\n\t  - usage.prompt_tokens\n\t    integer  \n\t    The number of tokens provided in the request prompt.  \n\t  - usage.completion_tokens\n\t    integer  \n\t    The number of tokens generated in the response output.  \n\t  - usage.total_tokens\n\t    integer  \n\t    The total number of tokens used in the chat completion (prompt + completion).  \n\t    We aim to send a logseq text block, from the open markdown file. Where such exist we should send the two previous 2 text blocks and the 2 following text blocks to set document context, placing the active text block in a broader frame. The text block will always start with -   \n\t    (hypen space)  \n\t    and will end with either EOF or new line n-   \n\t    denoting a new text block.  \n\t    A text block may JUST be a url, or might be extensive and encapsulate urls, hyperlinks, etc  \n\t  - We should send these to the perplexity API alongside the prompt which will be loaded from another file. Also sent will be an array of topics loaded from a csv. There may be dozens of such topics and they may contain spaces.\n\t  - On receipt of the response from perplexity the code should move the original core block (not the surrounding context blocks) into code fenced markdown between three ' and write the full response markdown from perplexity into the block child of that block.\n\t  ```\n-\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
