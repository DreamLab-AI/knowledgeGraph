These platforms provide immutable verification of waste collection, processing, recycling rates, and material recovery whilst enabling incentive mechanisms for responsible waste behaviour. Major implementations include Plastic Bank's blockchain-verified ocean plastic collection tracking 100+ million kg recovered, RecycleGO's smart bin networks across 45+ cities rewarding recycling participation, IBM's waste-to-energy verification systems, and the Empower platform's pay-as-you-throw tokenisation reducing household waste by 35-45%. These solutions support circular economy transitions, plastic credit markets, e-waste traceability, and zero waste certification programmes across municipalities, corporations, and supply chains.\n\t-\n\t- ### Global Waste Crisis and Industry Challenge\n\t  collapsed:: true\n\t\t- **Scale of Waste Problem**\n\t\t\t- 2.01 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste generated annually
