[[Bitcoin]] is the **first decentralised [[cryptocurrency]]** and the foundational implementation of [[blockchain]] [[technology]]. Created by [[Satoshi Nakamoto]] in 2008 and launched in January 2009, Bitcoin introduced a [[peer-to-peer]] electronic [[cash system]] that operates without requiring a [[trusted central authority]]. It combines [[cryptographic techniques]], [[distributed consensus]], and [[economic incentives]] to create a [[censorship-resistant]], [[scarce]] [[digital asset]] with a [[fixed supply]] of 21 million [[coins]].\n  -\n  - Bitcoin's significance extends beyond being merely the first cryptocurrency—it represents a novel solution to the [[Byzantine Generals Problem]] in [[distributed systems]], introduces a [[decentralised monetary policy]] enforced by [[mathematics]] rather than [[institutions]], and has catalysed an entire [[ecosystem]] of [[blockchain innovation]] and [[digital asset development]]. Bitcoin also enables emerging [[Bitcoin-AI]] integration patterns through protocols like [[L402-Protocol]] for [[micropayment]]-based [[AI services]], [[RGB and Client Side Validation]] for [[smart contracts]] on Bitcoin, and the [[Lightning and Similar L2]] payment network supporting the [[Agentic Internet]].\n  -\n  - ### Key Characteristics\n    id:: bitcoin-characteristics\n    - **[[Fixed Supply]]**: Maximum 21 million BTC, enforced by [[protocol consensus]]\n    - **[[Deflationary Design]]**: [[Halving]] of [[block rewards]] every 210,000 [[blocks]] (~4 years)\n    - **[[Proof-of-Work]] [[Security]]**: [[SHA-256]] based [[mining]] providing [[immutable]] [[transaction history]]\n    - **[[UTXO Model]]**: [[Unspent Transaction Output]] model for [[transaction accounting]]\n    - **[[Decentralized Consensus]]**: No [[central authority]], [[network]] agreement via [[longest chain rule]]\n    - **[[Programmable Transactions]]**: [[Script]] language enabling complex [[spending conditions]]\n    - **[[Global Accessibility]]**: [[Permissionless]] network accessible to anyone with [[internet]]\n    - **[[Pseudonymous]]**: [[Addresses]] not inherently linked to [[real-world identities]]\n  -\n  - ### Technical Components\n    id:: bitcoin-technical-components\n    - [[Block]] - Data structure containing transactions, previous block hash, nonce, timestamp\n    - [[Transaction]] - Transfer of bitcoin value between addresses using digital signatures\n    - [[Script]] - Stack-based programming language for transaction validation logic\n    - [[UTXO]] - Unspent transaction outputs representing spendable bitcoin\n    - [[Proof of Work]] - Computational puzzle requiring hash computation for block creation\n    - [[Mining]] - Process of creating new blocks and securing the network\n    - [[Node]] - Computer running Bitcoin software, validating and relaying transactions\n    - [[Wallet]] - Software managing private keys and constructing transactions\n    - [[Mempool]] - Pool of unconfirmed transactions awaiting inclusion in blocks\n  -\n  - ### Advanced Technical Features\n    id:: bitcoin-advanced-features\n\n    #### Bitcoin Script and Miniscript\n    - **[[BIP-0118]] ([[ANYPREVOUT]])**: [[Soft-fork]] enabling [[signature flexibility]] for advanced [[protocols]]\n      - Allows [[transactions]] to be signed without reference to specific previous [[outputs]], enabling any matching output to be dynamically applied later\n      - Unlocks advanced Bitcoin protocols like [[Eltoo]] for improved [[Lightning]] channels, [[statechains]] for [[off-chain]] [[UTXO]] transfers, and [[covenants]] for [[Bitcoin Vaults]] and [[spacechains]]\n      - Critical for [[Lightning Network]] improvements and [[Layer 2]] scalability\n      - [BIP-0118 Specification](https://anyprevout.xyz) - SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT implementation details\n\n    #### [[Lightning Network]]\n    - **[[Layer 2]] [[Payment Channel]] Network**: [[Off-chain]] [[transaction]] [[scalability]] solution\n    - **[[Eltoo Protocol]]**: Simplified [[channel update]] mechanism replacing [[penalty transactions]]\n      - [Eltoo Whitepaper](https://blockstream.com/eltoo.pdf) - Simplified update mechanism by Decker et al.\n      - [Readable Explanation by fiatjaf](https://fiatjaf.alhur.es/ffdfe772.html) - Community explanation\n    - Enables instant, low-fee [[micropayments]] for [[AI services]], [[content monetization]], and [[machine-to-machine payments]]\n    - Maintains Bitcoin's [[security guarantees]] through [[on-chain settlement]]\n    - Foundation for [[L402-Protocol]] enabling [[HTTP 402]] payment required responses for [[paywalled AI APIs]]\n\n    - **Network Growth and Adoption Metrics [Updated 2025]**:\n      Public [[Lightning]] capacity surpassed 5,000 BTC in early 2025, representing $475-509 million at contemporary prices—a 384% increase since 2020. Whilst network capacity experienced a decline from over 5,400 BTC in late 2023 to around 4,200 BTC by mid-2025 (approximately 20%), analysts and developers interpret this shift as reflecting structural evolution in [[routing]] and [[protocol design]] rather than diminished adoption. **[Updated 2025]**: As of November 2025, Lightning Network continues evolving as critical infrastructure for [[Bitcoin-AI]] integration, with [[L402-Protocol]] enabling [[pay-per-use AI]] models and [[micropayment]] streams for [[autonomous agents]].\n\n      The share of Bitcoin payments made via the Lightning Network reached **14.51% in 2024**, up from 7.95% in 2023 and 5.98% in 2022. More specifically, the percentage of Bitcoin payments processed via Lightning at CoinGate more than doubled in two years from 6.5% in Q2 2022 to 16.6% in Q2 2024. Public Lightning volume surged 266% year-over-year, whilst transaction counts decreased from 6.6 million (August 2023) to 2.4 million (2024 projection). This divergence indicates a fundamental shift towards higher-value transactions—particularly exchange deposits and withdrawals—rather than retail micropayments, suggesting Lightning's evolution from a micropayment curiosity to critical infrastructure.\n\n      Node count reached 16,000 with 75,000 active channels, but average channels per node decreased 30% between 2020-2024, indicating consolidation towards fewer, larger, better-connected nodes. This architectural maturation mirrors the broader internet's evolution from distributed to hub-and-spoke topologies, optimising for routing efficiency over pure decentralisation. Cash App saw 7× Lightning usage growth in 2024, whilst Tether's January 2025 announcement that USDT would launch on Bitcoin via Lightning Network represents a paradigm shift—bringing stablecoin functionality to Bitcoin's Layer 2 infrastructure and potentially unlocking Lightning's utility for commerce requiring price stability.\n\n    #### [[Miniscript]]\n    - Structured subset of [[Bitcoin Script]] enabling safer [[composition]]\n    - [[Formal analysis]] of [[spending conditions]]\n    - Improved [[wallet]] [[interoperability]] for complex [[scripts]]\n    - Enables [[RGB and Client Side Validation]] for advanced [[smart contract]] capabilities on Bitcoin\n  -\n  - ### Economic Properties\n    id:: bitcoin-economic-properties\n\n    #### Supply Schedule\n    - **Initial Block Reward**: 50 BTC (2009-2012)\n    - **Second Era**: 25 BTC (2012-2016)\n    - **Third Era**: 12.5 BTC (2016-2020)\n    - **Fourth Era**: 6.25 BTC (2020-April 2024)\n    - **Current Block Reward**: 3.125 BTC (April 2024-2028)\n      - The fourth halving occurred on 19th April 2024 at block 840,000\n      - This represents the fifth era of Bitcoin's monetary policy\n    - **Next Halving**: ~2028, reducing to 1.5625 BTC\n    - **Final Supply**: 21,000,000 BTC (estimated ~2140)\n    - **Current Circulating Supply**: ~19.8 million BTC (November 2025)\n      - Approximately 93.8% of total supply already mined\n      - Remaining 1.2 million BTC to be mined over next 115 years\n\n    #### Monetary Policy\n    - **Predictable Issuance**: Programmatic, transparent emission schedule\n    - **Deflationary Pressure**: Fixed cap creates scarcity\n    - **Halving Events**: Reduce inflation rate every 4 years\n    - **Stock-to-Flow Ratio**: Increasing scarcity metric\n\n    #### Market Context and Institutional Adoption [Updated 2025]\n    The fourth Bitcoin halving in April 2024 coincided with a watershed moment in [[institutional acceptance]]. Three months prior, in January 2024, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] approved 11 [[spot Bitcoin ETFs]], fundamentally transforming how [[traditional finance]] interacts with [[cryptocurrency]]. [[BlackRock]]'s [[IBIT]] alone attracted over $50 billion in [[assets under management]] within its first year, whilst the broader suite of spot ETFs saw net inflows of approximately $36.2 billion. This [[regulatory clarity]] triggered what [[MicroStrategy]]'s [[Michael Saylor]] termed \"year zero of institutional adoption\"—a 400% acceleration in institutional investment flows from a $15 billion pre-approval baseline to $75 billion in Q1 2024.\n\n    The halving's impact on [[price dynamics]] proved dramatic. Bitcoin established a new [[all-time high]] of $126,210.50 on **October 6, 2025** **[Updated 2025]**, demonstrating continued demand despite reduced block rewards. **[Updated 2025]**: By November 14, 2025, Bitcoin was trading at approximately **$99,887-$103,606**, with a [[market capitalization]] of **$1.98-2.11 trillion**. Trading volumes across global centralised exchanges rose to over $170 billion daily—three times the $56 billion average of late 2023. Notably, volumes of transfers larger than $1 million increased substantially, with a major peak in institutional volume observed in March 2024, highlighting a shift towards larger, more strategic cryptocurrency investments.\n\n    [[Corporate treasury]] adoption accelerated in parallel, with - ![image.png](../assets/image_1734450883984_0.png) - - [[MicroStrategy]] acquiring 257,000 BTC in 2024 alone, demonstrating how the ETF approval catalysed broader institutional commitment. [[JPMorgan Chase]] projected Bitcoin reaching $165,000 by year-end 2025, driven by liquidity tailwinds and the conclusion of [[quantitative tightening]], whilst [[VanEck]] maintained its $180,000 year-end target. **[Updated 2025]**: Bitcoin's [[hash rate]] reached **937-976 EH/s** in Q3 2025, with [[mining difficulty]] at all-time highs, indicating robust [[network security]] despite the reduced block reward.\n\n    **[Updated 2025]**: Total [[Bitcoin ETF]] [[AUM]] reached approximately **$134.6-170 billion** by October 2025, with [[institutional holdings]] of **$33.6 billion** in Q2 2025 representing **24.96%** of total ETF assets. [[BlackRock]]'s IBIT approached $100 billion in AUM, becoming one of the most successful ETF launches in history.\n\n    The convergence of halving mechanics, regulatory legitimacy, and institutional adoption represents a fundamental maturation of Bitcoin's role in [[global finance]]. What began as a peer-to-peer electronic cash experiment has evolved into a recognised [[asset class]] supporting emerging use cases including [[AI services]] monetization through [[Lightning Network]] and [[L402-Protocol]], [[tokenization]] via [[RGB and Client Side Validation]], and infrastructure for the [[Agentic Internet]].\n  -\n  - ### Value Proposition\n    id:: bitcoin-value-proposition\n\n    #### [[Monetary Sovereignty]]\n    - **[[Self-Custody]]**: Users control their own [[assets]] via [[private keys]]\n    - **[[Censorship Resistance]]**: No [[central authority]] can freeze or seize [[funds]]\n    - **[[Permissionless]]**: Anyone can [[transact]] without approval\n    - **[[Borderless]]**: [[Global network]] unrestricted by [[geography]]\n\n    #### [[Store of Value]]\n    - **[[Digital Scarcity]]**: Provably [[limited supply]]\n    - **[[Durability]]**: [[Cryptographically secured]], [[immutable ledger]]\n    - **[[Portability]]**: Transferable globally in minutes via [[Lightning Network]]\n    - **[[Divisibility]]**: Subdivided to 8 decimal places (100 million [[satoshis]] per BTC), enabling [[micropayments]] for [[AI services]] and [[machine-to-machine]] transactions\n\n    #### Environmental Impact and Sustainability\n    - **Renewable Energy Mining Study**: \"From Mining to Mitigation: How Bitcoin Can Support Renewable Energy Development and Climate Action\"\n      - Published in ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering\n      - **Emission Mitigation**: Bitcoin network mitigated 7.3% of its emissions without offsets\n      - Notable achievement across industries in voluntary emission reduction\n\n    - **Current Renewable Energy Usage [Updated 2025]**:\n      - **[Updated 2025]**: [[Cambridge study]] reports that **52.4% of Bitcoin mining now uses sustainable energy sources**, including **9.8% nuclear** and **42.6% renewables** such as [[hydropower]] and [[wind]], compared to a 2022 estimate of 37.6% overall sustainable energy use\n      - **[Updated 2025]**: [[Natural gas]] at 38.2% has replaced [[coal]] (now **8.9%**, down from 36.6% in 2022) as the single largest energy source used in Bitcoin mining, representing a significant shift away from the most [[carbon-intensive]] fuel source\n      - **[Updated 2025]**: As of 2025, 48% of electricity used in Bitcoin mining was generated through [[fossil fuels]] whilst **52% came from sustainable energy sources**, with estimates suggesting **50%-60%** from [[sustainable sources]] including nuclear\n      - **[Updated 2025]**: Bitcoin network [[hash rate]] reached **937-976 EH/s** in 2025, with the [[United States]] leading at **44% of global hash rate**, particularly in [[Texas]] due to deregulated energy markets and cheap renewables\n\n    - **Energy Transition Dynamics**:\n      Research reveals complex dynamics in Bitcoin mining's environmental trajectory. Whilst the shift towards sustainable energy has been substantial, studies show that the 34 largest U.S. bitcoin mines consumed 32.3 TWh of electricity in 2025, with fossil fuel power plants generating 85% of the increased electricity demand from these facilities. This highlights a geographic disparity: whilst global mining shows increasing renewable adoption, concentrated large-scale operations in certain jurisdictions remain heavily dependent on fossil fuel infrastructure.\n\n      The lottery-like mechanism of Bitcoin's proof-of-work mining, coupled with the intermittent nature of renewable energy, creates structural challenges. Green miners operating on intermittent renewable sources face disadvantages compared to brown miners with consistent fossil fuel access, as mining difficulty adjusts globally regardless of individual energy mix. However, research suggests that directing surplus electricity from intermittent renewable sources to bitcoin mining could reduce electricity curtailment, balance the electrical grid, and increase profitability of renewable energy plants—effectively allowing Bitcoin mining to act as a flexible load that can absorb excess renewable generation.\n\n    - **Opportunities and Innovations**:\n      - Incentivises renewable energy development in remote locations where grid connectivity is economically unviable\n      - Utilises stranded energy resources (flared natural gas, excess hydroelectric capacity, geothermal)\n      - Grid stabilisation through demand-response mining that can be interrupted during peak demand\n      - Pairing cryptocurrency mining with green hydrogen production offers potential for clean energy optimisation\n      - Mining operations increasingly co-locate with renewable energy projects, providing consistent revenue streams that improve project economics\n\n    - **Remaining Challenges**:\n      - Social impact in regions with volatile political conditions and energy scarcity\n      - Geographic concentration effects where cheap electricity availability drives mining location decisions\n      - Need for transparent reporting standards on energy mix and emissions\n      - Balancing network security requirements with environmental sustainability goals\n  -\n  -
