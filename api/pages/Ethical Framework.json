Ethical frameworks for AI translate philosophical traditions and moral reasoning into practical guidelines addressing unique challenges posed by algorithmic decision-making: how to ensure fairness when training data reflects historical discrimination, how to balance accuracy with transparency when complex models resist interpretation, how to assign responsibility when autonomous systems cause harm, and how to preserve human agency when AI systems make consequential recommendations. These frameworks draw from multiple ethical traditions including consequentialism (evaluating AI systems by their outcomes and impacts), deontology (establishing duties and rules AI systems must follow regardless of consequences), virtue ethics (cultivating organizational practices promoting responsible AI development), and care ethics (emphasizing relationships and contextual understanding). Ethical frameworks provide structured approaches for identifying, analyzing, and resolving moral dilemmas arising throughout the AI lifecycle, from data collection practices that may violate privacy, to model training that may embed biases, to deployment contexts where AI recommendations may conflict with human values.\n    - maturity:: mature\n    - source:: [[IEEE Ethically Aligned Design]], [[ACM Code of Ethics]], [[Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI]], [[Asilomar AI Principles]]\n    - authority-score:: 0.95\n\n  - **Semantic Classification**\n    - owl:class:: aigo:EthicalFramework\n    - owl:physicality:: ConceptualEntity\n    - owl:role:: Concept\n    - owl:inferred-class:: ConceptualConcept\n    - belongsToDomain:: [[AIEthicsDomain]]\n    - implementedInLayer:: [[ConceptualLayer]]\n\n  - #### Relationships\n    id:: ethical-framework-relationships\n    - is-subclass-of:: [[AI Governance Principle]]\n\n  - #### OWL Axioms\n    id:: ethical-framework-owl-axioms\n    collapsed:: true\n    - ```clojure\n      Prefix(:=<http://metaverse-ontology.org/ai-governance#>)\nPrefix(aigo:=<http://metaverse-ontology.org/ai-governance#>)\nPrefix(owl:=<http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>)\nPrefix(rdf:=<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>)\nPrefix(xml:=<http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace>)\nPrefix(xsd:=<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>)\nPrefix(rdfs:=<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>)\nPrefix(dct:=<http://purl.org/dc/terms/>)\nPrefix(skos:=<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#>)\n\nOntology(<http://metaverse-ontology.org/ai-governance/PC-0011>\n  Import(<http://metaverse-ontology.org/ai-governance/core>)\n  Import(<http://metaverse-ontology.org/ai-governance/PC-0010>)\n\n  ##

About Ethical Framework\n  id:: ethical-framework-about\n\n  - Ethical Frameworks for AI provide structured approaches to moral reasoning about the development and deployment of artificial intelligence systems, addressing unprecedented challenges at the intersection of technology, society, and human values. While traditional software engineering focuses on functional correctness and performance, AI systems raise fundamental questions about fairness, autonomy, dignity, and the distribution of benefits and harms across society—questions requiring moral rather than merely technical answers.\n\n  - AI ethics confronts unique challenges stemming from the nature of machine learning systems. Training data inevitably reflects historical patterns including systemic discrimination; should AI systems perpetuate these patterns for accuracy, or intervene to promote fairness at potential cost to predictive performance? Complex models like deep neural networks resist human interpretation; should society accept opaque decision-making for better outcomes, or require transparency even if it limits capabilities? AI systems operate at scale affecting millions; how do we ensure adequate oversight and accountability? Autonomous systems may cause harm in novel situations; how do we assign moral and legal responsibility? These dilemmas require ethical frameworks providing principled approaches to navigating competing values.\n\n  - Major ethical frameworks approach AI ethics from different philosophical traditions. Consequentialist approaches (including utilitarianism) evaluate AI systems by their outcomes—maximizing overall welfare, measuring algorithmic fairness through statistical metrics, conducting cost-benefit analyses of deployment. Deontological approaches establish categorical duties—respecting privacy regardless of accuracy gains, preserving human autonomy even when AI decisions might be superior, prohibiting uses violating human dignity. Virtue ethics focuses on cultivating organizational practices and professional norms promoting responsible development. Care ethics emphasizes relationships and context, arguing that ethical AI requires understanding particular situations rather than applying universal rules. Most practical frameworks employ ethical pluralism, drawing from multiple traditions to address different aspects of AI governance.\n\n  - ### Key Characteristics\n    id:: ethical-framework-characteristics\n    - **Moral Grounding**: Rooted in philosophical traditions and ethical theory\n    - **Principle-Based**: Establishes core values (fairness, transparency, accountability)\n    - **Harm Prevention**: Identifies and mitigates potential negative impacts\n    - **Rights Protection**: Safeguards human rights and fundamental freedoms\n    - **Value Balancing**: Provides methods for resolving conflicts between competing values\n    - **Contextual Application**: Adapts general principles to specific situations\n    - **Stakeholder Consideration**: Balances interests of multiple affected parties\n\n  - ### Subclasses\n    id:: ethical-framework-subclasses\n    - [[Fairness]] (AI-0397 onwards) - Equitable treatment across demographics\n    - [[Transparency]] - Understandable AI decision processes\n    - [[Accountability]] - Responsibility assignment and governance\n    - [[Privacy]] - Protection of personal information\n    - [[Autonomy]] - Preserving human agency and self-determination\n    - [[Beneficence]] - Promoting well-being and positive outcomes\n    - [[Non-maleficence]] - Avoiding harm and negative impacts\n    - [[Justice]] - Fair distribution of benefits and burdens\n    - [[Human Dignity]] - Respect for inherent human worth\n\n  - ### Use in Ontology\n    id:: ethical-framework-ontology-use\n    - **Ethical Classification**: Taxonomy of moral principles applied to AI\n    - **Value Conflict Resolution**: Framework for balancing competing ethical concerns\n    - **Harm Taxonomy**: Categorization of potential negative impacts\n    - **Rights Mapping**: Linking AI governance to human rights frameworks\n    - **Stakeholder Analysis**: Identifying affected parties and their interests\n    - **Ethical Assessment**: Criteria for evaluating AI system ethics\n\n\n\n## Academic Context\n\n- Ethical frameworks are systematically constructed sets of principles designed to provide reasoned justification for moral judgments and actions.\n  - They draw from diverse philosophical traditions such as utilitarianism (focusing on outcomes), deontology (focusing on duties and rules), and virtue ethics (focusing on character and moral virtues).\n  - Academic inquiry critically evaluates these perspectives, considering their historical evolution and applicability to contemporary ethical challenges, including sustainability and social justice.\n  - Ethical frameworks serve as tools for critical analysis, enabling the dissection of ethical dimensions in individual behaviour, social policies, and global systems.\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Ethical frameworks are widely adopted across industries to guide decision-making processes, ensuring accountability and integrity.\n  - Notable organisations and platforms incorporate ethical frameworks to navigate complex moral dilemmas, balancing stakeholder interests and societal impact.\n  - In the UK, especially in sectors such as healthcare, technology, and public administration, ethical frameworks underpin governance and operational standards.\n  - North England cities like Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield host institutions and companies integrating ethical considerations into AI development, data privacy, and community engagement.\n- Technical capabilities include algorithmic ethics in AI, ethical auditing tools, and decision-support systems, though limitations persist in quantifying moral values and resolving conflicts between competing ethical principles.\n- Established standards and frameworks include the Markkula Center’s ethical decision-making model, the UK’s NHS Code of Ethics, and ISO standards related to organisational ethics.\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic sources include:\n  - Beauchamp, T.L., & Childress, J.F.
