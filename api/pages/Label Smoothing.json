Label smoothing prevents overconfident predictions and improves model calibration and generalisation.\n\n\n\n\n## Academic Context\n\n- Label smoothing is a regularisation technique primarily used in classification tasks within machine learning and deep learning.\n  - It replaces hard one-hot encoded labels with soft targets by distributing a small portion of the probability mass to incorrect classes.\n  - This approach prevents models from becoming overly confident in their predictions, which can lead to overfitting and poor generalisation.\n- The technique was popularised by Szegedy et al. (2016) and is grounded in the principle of encouraging models to learn more generalisable representations rather than memorising training data.\n- Academically, label smoothing is understood as a modification of the target distribution in the loss function, often cross-entropy, to a convex combination of the original one-hot label and a uniform or learned noise distribution.\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Label smoothing is widely adopted across various domains including image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition.\n  - It is integrated into many state-of-the-art neural network training pipelines to improve model calibration and robustness.\n- Notable platforms and organisations implementing label smoothing include leading AI research labs and commercial AI platforms such as Ultralytics HUB.\n- Technically, label smoothing reduces the tendency of models to produce overconfident logits, which improves calibration but may slightly reduce maximum achievable accuracy if over-applied.\n- Recent research highlights a nuanced balance between improved generalisation and the risk of excessive regularisation, with ongoing efforts to adapt smoothing dynamically rather than uniformly.\n- Standards and frameworks for model training increasingly recommend label smoothing as a best practice for classification tasks, often alongside other regularisation methods.\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers include:\n  - Szegedy, C., Vanhoucke, V., Ioffe, S., Shlens, J., & Wojna, Z.
