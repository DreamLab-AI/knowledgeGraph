These models characterize maturity through defined levels (typically 1-5) representing progression from ad-hoc reactive practices to optimized proactive governance, with each level specifying capabilities, processes, and artifacts expected at that stage. Maturity dimensions typically include governance structure and leadership (executive commitment, organizational roles, policy frameworks), risk management (identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring), ethical practices (principles adoption, ethics review processes, fairness auditing), technical practices (documentation standards, testing protocols, monitoring systems), compliance and audit (regulatory alignment, audit procedures, evidence collection), stakeholder engagement (consultation processes, transparency practices, redress mechanisms), and continuous improvement (metrics collection, lessons learned, iterative enhancement). Assessment methodology involves self-assessment questionnaires, evidence review (documentation, process artifacts, system logs), stakeholder interviews, and external validation, producing maturity scores, gap analysis, and improvement roadmaps. Benefits include structured governance development avoiding ad-hoc approaches, prioritization of high-impact improvements, demonstration of due diligence to regulators and stakeholders, and facilitation of organizational learning. Models draw on maturity model methodologies from Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), ISO 21827 Systems Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model, and data governance maturity models, adapted for AI-specific governance challenges. Implementation examples include the Singapore Model AI Governance Framework maturity assessment and organizational maturity models from leading AI governance practitioners.\n    - maturity:: mature\n    -
