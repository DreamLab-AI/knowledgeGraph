(2025). \"A semantic approach to mapping the Provenance Ontology to Basic Formal Ontology.\" *Scientific Data*, 12, 1–15. doi: 10.1038/s41597-025-04580-1\n    - Presents comprehensive mapping methodology between PROV-O and BFO/CCO, with SPARQL-validated alignment criteria\n    - Demonstrates practical implementation through RDF Turtle files and Protégé integration\n  - W3C (2013). \"PROV-O: The PROV Ontology.\" W3C Recommendation. Available at: https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/\n    - Foundational specification document detailing term categories, class hierarchies, and property definitions\n  - Beverley, J. (2025). \"Mapping PROV to BFO.\" *Scientific Data* (open access publication)\n    - Accessible overview of structural and semantic considerations in ontology alignment\n- Ongoing research directions\n  - Interoperability enhancement between PROV-O and top-level ontologies remains an active research frontier\n  - Integration with machine learning provenance tracking systems continues to evolve\n  - FAIR principle compliance through semantic web technologies represents a sustained research priority\n\n## UK Context\n\n- British contributions and implementations\n  - The W3C standardisation process has benefited from UK-based semantic web researchers and institutions\n  - PROV-O adoption within UK research infrastructure, particularly in data-intensive disciplines, supports reproducibility and open science initiatives\n  - UK universities increasingly incorporate PROV-O into research data management systems to satisfy funder requirements (UKRI, Wellcome Trust) for data provenance documentation\n- North England innovation hubs\n  - Manchester's research computing community has engaged with PROV-O implementation in bioinformatics and computational chemistry workflows\n  - Leeds and Sheffield universities have explored PROV-O integration within institutional data repositories and research data management platforms\n  - Newcastle's digital humanities initiatives have investigated provenance tracking for collaborative research projects\n- Regional case studies\n  - Information remains limited regarding specific North England case studies; however, the region's strong computational research base suggests growing adoption within research infrastructure modernisation efforts\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends and developments\n  - Automated provenance capture in AI/ML pipelines represents a significant growth area, with PROV-O serving as the formal backbone for experiment tracking systems\n  - Expansion of PROV-O mappings to additional foundational ontologies will enhance cross-domain interoperability\n  - Integration with blockchain and distributed ledger technologies for immutable provenance records shows exploratory promise\n- Anticipated challenges\n  - Semantic alignment complexity increases as PROV-O integrates with increasingly diverse ontological frameworks\n  - Scalability considerations for large-scale provenance graphs in high-throughput research environments require ongoing attention\n  - User adoption barriers persist; simplified tooling and documentation remain necessary for non-specialist practitioners\n- Research priorities\n  - Development of domain-specific PROV-O profiles for specialised applications (clinical research, environmental monitoring, digital humanities)\n  - Enhanced reasoning capabilities for complex provenance queries across federated systems\n  - Improved visualisation and querying interfaces to make provenance information more accessible to domain experts\n\n## References\n\n1.
