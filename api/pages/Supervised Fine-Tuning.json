Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) represents the most direct path from general pre-training to task-specific capability.\n\n\n## Academic Context\n\n- Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is a machine learning technique that adapts a pre-trained model to specific tasks by continuing training on labelled input-output pairs.\n  - It builds on the foundation of large-scale pre-training, where models learn general language or vision patterns from vast unlabelled data.\n  - SFT optimises model parameters through supervised learning, maximising the likelihood of correct outputs given inputs, akin to behaviour cloning in imitation learning.\n  - The approach is grounded in statistical learning theory and has connections to reinforcement learning, especially when combined with preference or reward signals to improve alignment.\n  - Key theoretical developments include understanding SFT as a lower bound optimisation on expected rewards under filtered data, and techniques to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning.\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- SFT is widely adopted across industry to transform generic large language models (LLMs) and vision models into specialised, instruction-following AI systems.\n  - It is the primary method for creating domain-specific assistants, chatbots, summarisation tools, and other task-oriented applications.\n  - Modern pipelines often combine SFT with techniques like Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for enhanced performance.\n  - Dataset quality and curation are paramount; smaller, high-quality labelled datasets outperform large but noisy corpora in fine-tuning effectiveness.\n- Notable organisations utilising SFT include major AI labs and cloud providers offering fine-tuning APIs, as well as startups specialising in custom AI solutions.\n- In the UK, and particularly in North England cities such as Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield, AI research centres and tech companies increasingly integrate SFT into their workflows.\n  - Manchester’s AI hubs focus on healthcare and legal tech applications, leveraging SFT to tailor models to sensitive, domain-specific data.\n  - Leeds and Sheffield have growing AI clusters applying SFT in industrial automation and natural language processing for regional business needs.\n- Technical limitations remain around catastrophic forgetting, data bias, and the computational cost of fine-tuning large models, though parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are mitigating these challenges.\n- Standards and frameworks for SFT are evolving, with increasing emphasis on transparency, data provenance, and ethical considerations in supervised datasets.\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers:\n  - Qin, Y., et al.
