(2017), which demonstrated the feasibility of such attacks across various model architectures and cloud-based services\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption of machine learning has increased the relevance of membership inference attacks, particularly in sectors handling sensitive personal data such as finance, healthcare, and public services\n  - Major cloud providers and AI platforms have implemented mitigation strategies, including differential privacy and model obfuscation, to reduce the risk of membership inference\n  - In the UK, organisations such as the Alan Turing Institute and NHS Digital have published guidance on privacy-preserving machine learning, reflecting growing awareness of these threats\n  - North England innovation hubs, including the Digital Health Enterprise Zone in Greater Manchester, are actively researching privacy-preserving AI techniques, with some projects focusing on mitigating membership inference in healthcare applications\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers and sources\n  - Shokri, R., Stronati, M., Song, C., & Shmatikov, V.
