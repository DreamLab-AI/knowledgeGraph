European Telecommunications Standards Institute. [Establishes foundational AI security requirements across lifecycle phases][1]\n  - ITU-T (April 2025). *Recommendation ITU-T X.1648 – Guideline on edge computing security*. International Telecommunication Union. [Addresses data security in edge computing environments, particularly for healthcare and video processing][2]\n  - Lonc, B. (2025).
