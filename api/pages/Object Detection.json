Object detectors (YOLO, Faster R-CNN, DETR) combine classification and localisation, outputting spatial coordinates and class probabilities for all objects of interest in real-time or near-real-time performance.\n\n\n\n## Academic Context\n\n- Object detection represents a fundamental advancement in computer vision, merging classification and localisation into a unified framework[1][2][3]\n  - Distinguishes itself from image classification by providing precise spatial coordinates alongside categorical labels[3]\n  - Combines two core challenges: determining *what* objects are present and *where* they are located within visual space[1]\n  - Evolved from early feature-based methods to modern deep learning approaches utilising convolutional neural networks and transformer architectures[1]\n\n- The field has matured considerably, with contemporary models achieving unprecedented accuracy and computational efficiency[1]\n  - Modern architectures increasingly leverage transformer-based designs alongside traditional CNN approaches[1]\n  - Two principal methodological branches persist: single-stage detectors (YOLO, SSD) prioritising speed, and two-stage detectors (Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN) emphasising precision[2]\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption spans autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, medical imaging, retail inventory management, and agricultural monitoring[5]\n  - Real-time decision-making capabilities enable practical deployment in safety-critical applications[5]\n  - Confidence scoring mechanisms provide quantifiable uncertainty estimates alongside predictions[4]\n\n- Technical capabilities and performance characteristics\n  - Single-stage detectors achieve real-time performance through unified prediction pipelines[2]\n  - Two-stage detectors employ region proposal mechanisms followed by refinement, trading latency for enhanced accuracy[2]\n  - Mask R-CNN extends capabilities to pixel-wise segmentation for detailed object delineation[2]\n  - Non-maximum suppression techniques resolve overlapping bounding box predictions[3]\n\n- Processing pipeline standardisation\n  - Input preprocessing enhances image quality and normalisation[2]\n  - Feature extraction isolates shape, texture, and colour characteristics[2]\n  - Algorithm application generates predictions with associated confidence metrics[2]\n  - Bounding box coordinate calculation and post-processing derive actionable insights[3]\n\n- Current limitations remain evident in edge cases\n  - Occlusion handling and small object detection present ongoing challenges\n  - Domain-specific fine-tuning requirements persist despite transfer learning advances\n  - Computational resource demands vary significantly across model architectures\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Foundational methodologies and contemporary developments\n  - Girshick, R., Donahue, J., Darrell, T., & Malik, J.
