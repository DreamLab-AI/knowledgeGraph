Adapter modules provide a parameter-efficient way to adapt pre-trained models to new tasks by learning task-specific transformations without modifying the base model.\n\n\n## Academic Context\n\n- Adapter modules are compact neural network components inserted between transformer layers, designed to enable efficient fine-tuning of large pre-trained models by training only these modules while keeping the base model parameters frozen.\n  - They typically employ a bottleneck architecture consisting of down-projection, nonlinearity (e.g., ReLU or tanh), and up-projection layers, often with skip connections to preserve original representations.\n  - Variants include serial and parallel adapters, prompt-based methods, low-rank re-parameterisations (e.g., LoRA), sparse adapters, and dynamic adapters that adapt insertion points or module combinations per task.\n- The academic foundation lies in parameter-efficient transfer learning, allowing adaptation to new tasks without full retraining, reducing computational and memory costs while maintaining performance.\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Adapter modules have become a standard technique for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and transformers across NLP and other domains, widely adopted in both research and industry.\n  - Notable implementations include integration into models like DistilBERT, LLaMA2, and Gemma, with advanced variants such as RaNA adapters achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy and efficiency.\n  - Techniques like selective adapter freezing further optimise memory usage during fine-tuning.\n- In the UK, several AI research groups and companies leverage adapter modules for domain-specific applications, including legal document analysis and biomedical NLP.\n  - North England hubs such as Manchester and Leeds have active AI research communities exploring efficient model adaptation, often collaborating with industry partners to deploy adapter-based solutions.\n- Technical capabilities include:\n  - Significant parameter savings compared to full fine-tuning.\n  - Flexibility to add or remove adapters for multi-task learning.\n  - Limitations involve potential performance trade-offs on highly divergent tasks and the complexity of managing multiple adapters.\n- Standards and frameworks supporting adapters are evolving, with open-source libraries (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers) providing modular adapter integration and community-driven benchmarks.\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers:\n  - Houlsby et al.
