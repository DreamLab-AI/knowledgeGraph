This remains a core function.\n\t- Over time, many central banks have expanded their role as lender of last resort beyond just commercial banks to also support non-bank financial entities that face liquidity shortages in crises. Central banks have effectively become backstops for the broader financial system.\n\t- Central banks control short-term interest rates through policy tools like adjusting benchmark rates (e.g. fed funds rate), reserve requirements, open market operations, etc. This allows them to influence longer-term rates and overall financial conditions.\n\t- Central banks engage in quantitative easing and asset purchase programs to lower longer-term rates. They buy financial assets like government bonds and mortgages to inject liquidity and expand the money supply.\n\t- As a result of asset purchases and liquidity programs, most major central banks have dramatically expanded their balance sheets and the monetary base since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\t- Central banks earn income on assets purchased but also pay interest on reserves. Most remit profits back to national treasuries/governments after covering expenses. Some now face losses.\n\t- While politically independent, central banks face pressure from politicians and the public. They have mandates like inflation targeting, financial stability, employment, etc. that shape policy.\n\t- Central bank policies like QE and low rates for long periods are criticized for enabling fiscal deficits and debt levels to rise and inflating asset bubbles. But also defended as supporting growth.\n\t- Extraordinary central bank actions during crises like COVID-19 have fueled high inflation worldwide. They face challenges normalizing policy and credibility issues.\n\t- As lenders of last resort with balance sheet expansion power, central banks have uniquely influential roles in national and global finance. Their policies have major economic and political impacts.\n\n- # Central Banks\n\t- Central banks were established to be lenders of last resort, providing liquidity to commercial banks during financial crises to prevent bank runs and systemic crises.

R. (2013). *Macroeconomics* (6th ed.). Pearson. [Foundational theories on inflation dynamics]\n  - Ball, L., & Mankiw, N. G. (2020). \"The NAIRU in Theory and Practice.\" *Journal of Economic Perspectives*, 34(1), 115-136. https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.34.1.115 [Explores natural rate of unemployment and inflation relationship]\n  - Bean, C. (2024). \"Inflation Targeting and Monetary Policy in the UK.\" *Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin*, Q1 2024. [UK-specific policy analysis]\n- Ongoing research focuses on:\n  - The impact of post-pandemic supply chain adjustments on inflation persistence.\n  - Regional inflation differentials within the UK, emphasising North England’s economic structure.\n  - The role of energy price volatility and climate policy in shaping inflation trajectories.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK has experienced a pronounced cost of living crisis since 2022, driven by energy price surges and supply chain disruptions, with inflation peaking at 11.1% in October 2022 before moderating.\n- British institutions such as the ONS and Bank of England provide authoritative inflation data and policy guidance.\n- North England innovation hubs, particularly in Manchester and Leeds, have developed regional economic strategies to mitigate inflation’s impact on households and businesses.\n  - For example, Leeds City Region’s economic partnership has implemented targeted support for housing affordability and transport cost management.\n  - Newcastle and Sheffield have focused on industrial diversification to buffer inflation shocks.\n- Regional case studies reveal persistent disparities in inflation impact, with lower-income households in North England disproportionately affected due to higher relative expenditure on housing and energy.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include:\n  - Enhanced inflation measurement granularity using big data and machine learning to capture micro-level price changes.\n  - Integration of environmental and social governance (ESG) factors into inflation forecasting models.\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Balancing inflation control with economic growth amid geopolitical uncertainties and energy transition.\n  - Addressing regional inflation disparities to ensure equitable economic recovery.\n- Research priorities:\n  - Developing adaptive monetary policies responsive to rapid sectoral inflation shifts.\n  - Investigating inflation expectations formation in diverse UK demographic groups.\n  - Evaluating the long-term effects of inflation on UK productivity and competitiveness.\n\n## References\n\n1.
