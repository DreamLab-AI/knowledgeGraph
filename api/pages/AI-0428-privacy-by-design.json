This approach follows seven foundational principles articulated by Ann Cavoukian including proactive not reactive prevention (anticipating and preventing privacy risks before they materialize), privacy as default setting (systems configured for maximum privacy protection without user intervention), privacy embedded into design (integrated into system architecture and business operations as essential component), full functionality positive-sum not zero-sum (avoiding false dichotomies between privacy and other objectives, achieving both through innovative design), end-to-end security protecting data throughout lifecycle (from collection through retention to destruction), visibility and transparency (keeping systems open and accountable with clear documentation), and respect for user privacy (maintaining user-centric focus with empowering privacy controls). Implementation patterns documented in privacy design strategies include minimize collecting and retaining only essential data, hide protecting data from unauthorized observation through encryption and access controls, separate preventing correlation of data across contexts through architectural partitioning, aggregate processing data at group level rather than individually where possible, inform providing transparency about data practices and system behavior, control giving users meaningful choices over data processing, enforce implementing technical measures ensuring compliance with privacy policies, and demonstrate maintaining evidence of privacy compliance for accountability. GDPR Article 25 requirements mandate data protection by design requiring controllers implement appropriate technical and organizational measures (pseudonymization, minimization, security) designed to implement data protection principles effectively and integrate necessary safeguards into processing, and data protection by default ensuring only personal data necessary for specific processing purpose is processed by default in terms of amount collected, extent of processing, storage period, and accessibility, with implementation considering state of the art (current best practices and technologies), cost of implementation (proportionate to processing scale and risks), nature of processing (sensitivity, volume, complexity), and purposes of processing (primary objectives and downstream uses). AI-specific applications address model privacy preventing memorization of training examples through techniques like differential privacy, data privacy protecting input features and labels through federated learning or encrypted computation, inference privacy preventing leakage through prediction patterns using secure multi-party computation or trusted execution environments, explainability privacy balancing transparency requirements with proprietary model protection, and fairness privacy ensuring bias mitigation doesn't inadvertently expose protected attribute distributions, with evaluation through privacy assessment scores measuring design embedding completeness, implementation phase tracking (requirements, design, development, deployment, maintenance), and compliance level verification against regulatory requirements demonstrating adequate protection measures.\n    - maturity:: mature\n    - source:: [[Cavoukian (2009)]], [[GDPR Article 25]], [[ISO 29100]]\n    - authority-score:: 0.95\n\n  - **Semantic Classification**\n    - owl:class:: aigo:PrivacyByDesign\n    - owl:physicality:: VirtualEntity\n    - owl:role:: Process\n    - owl:inferred-class:: aigo:VirtualProcess\n    - belongsToDomain:: [[AIEthicsDomain]]\n\n  - #### CrossDomainBridges\n    - bridges-from:: [[PrivacyImpactAssessmentPia]] via enables\n    - implementedInLayer:: [[ConceptualLayer]]\n\n  - #### Relationships\n    id:: 0428-privacy-by-design-relationships\n\n  - #### OWL Axioms\n    id:: 0428-privacy-by-design-owl-axioms\n    collapsed:: true\n    - ```clojure\n      (Declaration (Class :PrivacyByDesign))\n(SubClassOf :PrivacyByDesign :PrivacyPreservingTechnique)\n\n;; Core Relationships\n(SubClassOf :PrivacyByDesign\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :embeds :PrivacyProtections))\n(SubClassOf :PrivacyByDesign\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :implements :ProactiveApproach))\n(SubClassOf :PrivacyByDesign\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :ensures :DefaultPrivacy))\n(SubClassOf :PrivacyByDesign\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :integrates :PrivacyIntoArchitecture))\n(SubClassOf :PrivacyByDesign\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :maintains :UserCentricity))\n(SubClassOf :PrivacyByDesign\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :provides :EndToEndSecurity))\n(SubClassOf :PrivacyByDesign\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :enables :Transparency))\n(SubClassOf :PrivacyByDesign\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :supports :UserControl))\n\n;; Seven Foundational Principles (Cavoukian)\n(SubClassOf :PrivacyByDesign\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :follows\n    (ObjectUnionOf :ProactiveNotReactive\n                   :PrivacyAsDefault\n                   :PrivacyEmbeddedInDesign\n                   :FullFunctionality\n                   :EndToEndSecurity\n                   :VisibilityTransparency\n                   :RespectForUserPrivacy)))\n\n;; Design Patterns\n(SubClassOf :PrivacyByDesign\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :employs\n    (ObjectUnionOf :MinimisePattern\n                   :SeparatePattern\n                   :AggregatePattern\n                   :HidePattern\n                   :InformPattern\n                   :ControlPattern\n                   :EnforcePattern\n                   :DemonstratePattern)))\n\n;; AI-Specific Considerations\n(SubClassOf :PrivacyByDesign\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :addresses\n    (ObjectUnionOf :ModelPrivacy\n                   :DataPrivacy\n                   :InferencePrivacy\n                   :ExplainabilityPrivacy\n                   :FairnessPrivacy)))\n\n;; GDPR Article 25\n(SubClassOf :PrivacyByDesign\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :implements\n    (ObjectIntersectionOf :DataProtectionByDesign\n                         :DataProtectionByDefault\n                         :StateOfTheArt\n                         :CostOfImplementation\n                         :NatureOfProcessing)))\n\n;; Data Properties\n(SubClassOf :PrivacyByDesign\n  (DataHasValue :privacyAssessmentScore\n    (DatatypeRestriction xsd:float (MinInclusive \"0.0\") (MaxInclusive \"100.0\"))))\n(SubClassOf :PrivacyByDesign\n  (DataHasValue :implementationPhase xsd:string))\n(SubClassOf :PrivacyByDesign\n  (DataHasValue :complianceLevel xsd:string))\n      ```\n\n- ## Future of Accessibility in Design\n\t- The future of accessibility in both immersive and non-immersive software hinges on continuous innovation and research.
