(2024). *The LLaMA 3 Herd of Models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2407.21783. DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2407.21783\n    - This paper details LLaMA 3’s architecture, multilingual and multimodal capabilities, and extensive empirical evaluation showing parity with leading models.\n  - Meta AI Blog (2025). *The LLaMA 4 Herd: The Beginning of a New Era of Natively Multimodal Intelligence*.\n    - Describes the introduction of MoE architecture and multimodal processing in LLaMA 4.\n- Ongoing research explores:\n  - Scaling MoE architectures for efficiency.\n  - Extending context windows to millions of tokens.\n  - Enhancing safety and robustness in open-weight models.\n  - Integrating multimodal inputs including video and speech.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK has embraced LLaMA models within academic and industrial AI research communities.\n  - Universities in Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield contribute to foundational AI research and applied projects utilising LLaMA.\n  - Innovation hubs in North England foster startups and collaborations deploying LLaMA for natural language understanding, healthcare analytics, and digital humanities.\n- Regional case studies include:\n  - A Manchester-based AI lab using LLaMA 4 Scout for large-scale document summarisation in legal tech.\n  - Leeds tech firms integrating LLaMA models for customer support chatbots with extended context awareness.\n- The UK’s AI ecosystem benefits from LLaMA’s open-source nature, enabling cost-effective experimentation and deployment.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends:\n  - Further expansion of multimodal capabilities, including seamless integration of text, image, video, and speech.\n  - Development of even larger MoE models, such as the anticipated LLaMA 4 Behemoth with trillions of parameters.\n  - Advances in context window scaling to support complex, multi-document reasoning and personalised AI assistants.\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Balancing model size and inference efficiency.\n  - Ensuring safety and mitigating hallucinations, especially with extremely long context windows.\n  - Addressing ethical and regulatory concerns in open-weight model deployment.\n- Research priorities:\n  - Improving model interpretability and controllability.\n  - Enhancing multilingual and cross-domain generalisation.\n  - Developing robust safety guardrails that scale with model complexity.\n\n## References\n\n1.
