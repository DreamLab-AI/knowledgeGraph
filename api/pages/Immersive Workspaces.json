Their technology is used by organisations including the NHS and local councils for immersive training and scenario planning.\n      - **Digital Catapult (Newcastle):** Supports immersive technology adoption through its North East Digital Innovation Hub, offering access to XR hardware and expertise for SMEs and public sector organisations.\n      - **University of Leeds:** Hosts immersive labs for research in spatial computing, digital twins, and collaborative design, often partnering with local industry.\n      - **Accenture UK:** Uses VR-based immersive workspaces for onboarding, training, and client collaboration, with offices in Manchester and Leeds leveraging these technologies.\n    - Regional initiatives such as the Northern Powerhouse and Innovate UK grants have accelerated adoption in North England.\n  - ## Key Research Papers and Sources\n    - Greenwold, S.
