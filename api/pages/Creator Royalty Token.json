These tokens enable creators to raise capital by selling future royalty rights to fans, investors, or collectors while automating payment distribution through smart contracts. Creator Royalty Tokens democratize access to intellectual property investment, allowing supporters to participate in the economic success of creators they believe in.\n\t- Traditional royalty systems in creative industries suffer from opacity, delayed payments, complex accounting, and high intermediary costs. Music artists wait months for streaming royalties passing through labels, publishers, and collection societies. Visual artists rarely receive secondary market compensation. Creator Royalty Tokens address these inefficiencies by encoding royalty terms directly into blockchain-based smart contracts that automatically distribute payments whenever revenue is generated. This creates transparent, instant, and programmable revenue sharing aligned with creator and holder interests.\n\t- The tokenization of creative royalties represents a fundamental shift in intellectual property financing and creator economics. Rather than selling exclusive rights to publishers or labels, creators can fractionalize ownership across thousands of token holders while retaining creative control. Fans become stakeholders with aligned incentives to promote works. Secondary markets provide liquidity for royalty investments. As the metaverse and creator economy expand, Creator Royalty Tokens are emerging as essential infrastructure for sustainable creator livelihoods and participatory culture.\n\t- ### Key

royalty tokens represent a novel intersection of blockchain technology and intellectual property rights, enabling automated, transparent, and fractional distribution of revenue from creative works\n\t- The concept builds upon earlier models of digital rights management and smart contracts, but introduces decentralised, programmable ownership of income streams\n- Key developments and current state\n\t- The field has matured beyond experimental prototypes, with several platforms and standards now supporting real-world deployment of royalty tokens\n\t- Academic interest has grown, particularly in the areas of digital economics, blockchain governance, and creative industries\n- Academic foundations\n\t- Rooted in distributed ledger theory, smart contract design, and digital asset management\n\t- Draws from interdisciplinary research in law, economics, and computer science\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n\t- Creator royalty tokens are increasingly used in music, visual arts, and digital collectibles, with platforms such as Audius, Opulous, and Royal leading the way\n\t- The model is gaining traction among independent
