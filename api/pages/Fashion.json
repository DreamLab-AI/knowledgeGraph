(github.com)](https://github.com/cozymantis/human-parser-comfyui-node)\n-\n- Fashion 3D objects\n\t- The landscape of 3D fashion has significantly evolved by June 2025, with artificial intelligence playing a pivotal role in design, production, and consumer experience. Digital garments are now commonplace in virtual worlds and gaming, offering new avenues for self-expression. AI-driven tools facilitate rapid prototyping, allowing designers to iterate on virtual clothing much faster than traditional methods. Virtual try-on technologies, enhanced by advanced AI, provide realistic simulations for online shoppers, reducing returns and improving customer satisfaction. Furthermore, generative AI is increasingly used to create unique textile patterns and even entire clothing collections, pushing the boundaries of creativity in the fashion industry.\n\t- TODO write a script to start the docker for CRM\n\t- DONE Bind it to llama3\n- Binding social immersive spaces with AI\n\t- By mid-2025, the integration of AI within social immersive spaces, often referred to as the metaverse, has deepened considerably. AI agents and non-player characters (NPCs) are becoming more sophisticated, offering dynamic interactions and personalised experiences within these virtual environments. These AI entities can serve as guides, companions, or even perform complex tasks, enhancing user engagement. The development of more advanced [[Metaverse Ontology]] and [[Ontology conversation with AIs]] is crucial for creating coherent and interoperable virtual worlds. AI is also instrumental in content generation, enabling users to create complex 3D assets and environments with simple prompts. Moreover, AI-powered moderation systems are vital for maintaining safe and inclusive social spaces, addressing issues like harassment and misinformation in real-time. The concept of [[Agentic Mycelia]] and a [[Agentic Metaverse for Global Creatives]] highlights the potential for interconnected, intelligent agents to foster collaborative and innovative virtual ecosystems. The ongoing work on [[Multi Agent RAG scrapbook]] further explores how multiple AI agents can leverage vast knowledge bases to provide richer, more informed interactions within these immersive settings.\n\n\t-\n\n    - Fashion 3D objects\n\t- TODO write a script to start the docker for CRM\n\t\t- ```text\n\t\t  machinelearn@MLAI:/mnt/mldata/GenerativeAI/ComfyUI$ docker ps\n\t\t  CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                  COMMAND                  CREATED        STATUS        PORTS                                       NAMES\n\t\t  d8bc0b15a890   yanwk/comfyui-boot:megapak             \"bash /runner-script…\"   9 hours ago    Up 9 hours    0.0.0.0:8188->8188/tcp, :::8188->8188/tcp   comfyui-mega\n\t\t  7428acfbd648   ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama   \"bash start.sh\"          27 hours ago   Up 22 hours   0.0.0.0:3000->8080/tcp, :::3000->8080/tcp   open-webui\n\t\t  machinelearn@MLAI:/mnt/mldata/GenerativeAI/ComfyUI$ docker stop comfyui-mega\n\t\t  comfyui-mega\n\n\n\t- [[Metaverse Ontology]]\n\t- [[Ontology conversation with AIs]]\n\t- [[Knowledge Management and Graphing]]\n\t- [[Agentic Mycelia]]\n\t- [[Agentic Metaverse for Global Creatives]]\n\t- [[Multi Agent RAG scrapbook]]\n\t-\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
