many protocols experience low voter turnout despite decentralisation rhetoric\n\n- Technical constraints worth noting\n  - Governance tokens do not alter fundamental blockchain immutability; they influence only modifiable parameters\n  - The 2016 DAO hack and subsequent Ethereum hard fork demonstrated that even \"immutable\" systems require human intervention during crises—a sobering reminder that code is not quite law\n\n### Standards and Frameworks\n\n- Governance token design lacks universal standardisation, with each protocol developing bespoke mechanisms\n  - ERC-20 and similar token standards provide technical foundations, but governance logic remains protocol-specific\n  - Emerging frameworks attempt to standardise voting thresholds, proposal timelines, and delegation mechanisms\n  - No unified UK regulatory framework currently exists; governance tokens occupy an ambiguous space between securities and utility assets\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic and industry sources\n  - CoinMarketCap Academy. \"Governance Token Definition.\" Available at: https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/glossary/governance-token\n  - Kraken Learn. \"What is a Governance Token?\" Available at: https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-a-governance-token\n  - Cube Exchange. \"What is Governance Token?
