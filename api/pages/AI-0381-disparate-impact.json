Originating from US employment law (EEOC Uniform Guidelines 1978) and extended to UK and EU anti-discrimination frameworks, disparate impact is measured by comparing selection rates, approval rates, or outcome rates between protected and unprotected groups. The \"80 percent rule\" (four-fifths rule) establishes that disparate impact exists when the selection rate for a protected group is less than 80 percent of the rate for the highest-performing group, calculated as a disparate impact ratio. Unlike disparate treatment (intentional direct discrimination), disparate impact focuses on discriminatory outcomes rather than discriminatory intent. Legal defenses include business necessity (US) - demonstrating the practice is job-related and consistent with business necessity, and proportionate means (UK/EU) - showing the practice is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. In AI systems, disparate impact analysis requires statistical testing of algorithmic decisions across demographic groups, documentation of less discriminatory alternatives if available, and compliance with sector-specific regulations in employment, lending, insurance, and housing domains.\n    - maturity:: mature\n    - source:: [[US EEOC Uniform Guidelines]], [[UK Equality Act 2010]], [[EU Anti-Discrimination Directives]]\n    - authority-score:: 0.95\n\n  - **Semantic Classification**\n    - owl:class:: aigo:DisparateImpact\n    - owl:physicality:: VirtualEntity\n    - owl:role:: Process\n    - owl:inferred-class:: aigo:VirtualProcess\n    - belongsToDomain:: [[AIEthicsDomain]]\n    - implementedInLayer:: [[ConceptualLayer]]\n\n  - #### Relationships\n    id:: 0381-disparate-impact-relationships\n\n  - #### OWL Axioms\n    id:: 0381-disparate-impact-owl-axioms\n    collapsed:: true\n    - ```clojure\n      (Declaration (Class :DisparateImpact))\n(SubClassOf :DisparateImpact :LegalConcept)\n(SubClassOf :DisparateImpact :AlgorithmicBias)\n\n(AnnotationAssertion rdfs:label :DisparateImpact\n  \"Disparate Impact\"@en)\n(AnnotationAssertion rdfs:comment :DisparateImpact\n  \"Discriminatory effect of facially neutral policies that disproportionately affect protected groups, measured by the 80% rule (four-fifths rule) under US employment law.\"@en)\n(AnnotationAssertion :dcterms:source :DisparateImpact\n  \"US EEOC Uniform Guidelines (1978), UK Equality Act 2010, EU Anti-Discrimination Directives\")\n\n;;
