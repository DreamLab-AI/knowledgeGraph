DOI: 10.1145/2976749.2978390.\n- Ongoing research explores:\n  - Energy consumption optimisation and alternative consensus algorithms.\n  - Economic modelling of mining incentives under varying reward structures.\n  - Regulatory impacts on mining operations and reward mechanisms.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK has seen growing interest in blockchain mining, though energy costs and regulatory frameworks have limited large-scale PoW mining operations.\n- North England, particularly cities like Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield, hosts innovation hubs focusing on blockchain technology development and sustainable crypto solutions.\n  - Manchester’s tech scene includes startups exploring hybrid consensus models and green mining initiatives.\n  - Leeds and Newcastle universities contribute research on blockchain scalability and energy-efficient consensus.\n- Regional case studies highlight pilot projects integrating renewable energy sources to power mining rigs, aiming to reduce carbon footprints and regulatory risks.\n- The UK government and regulatory bodies maintain a cautious stance, emphasising compliance with financial and environmental regulations.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include:\n  - Increased adoption of Proof-of-Stake and other low-energy consensus mechanisms reducing reliance on traditional mining rewards.\n  - Integration of dynamic fee markets where transaction fees play a larger role in miner/validator compensation.\n  - Development of hybrid consensus models combining PoW and PoS elements.\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Balancing network security with environmental sustainability.\n  - Navigating evolving regulatory landscapes, especially concerning the classification of mining rewards.\n  - Maintaining decentralisation as mining consolidates into fewer, larger pools.\n- Research priorities:\n  - Designing incentive mechanisms that align miner behaviour with long-term network health.\n  - Exploring the socio-economic impacts of mining reward structures in different jurisdictions.\n  - Enhancing transparency and auditability of mining reward distributions.\n\n## References\n\n1.
