the debate centers on who will build them and for what purpose.\n\t\t\t- Historically, the threat of catastrophic weapons (e.g., nuclear bombs) has maintained global peace, preventing major world wars.\n\t\t\t- U.S. military supremacy has played a significant role in deterring conflicts.\n\t\t\t- The future of warfare lies in AI-driven technologies, surpassing conventional weapons.\n\t\t\t- Development of AI in military contexts faces resistance from Silicon Valley engineers and companies.\n\t\t\t- Examples include Google abandoning Project Maven and Microsoft employees opposing an augmented-reality project for the U.S. Army.\n\t\t\t- Despite resistance, companies like Palantir are committed to developing AI for defense.\n\t\t\t- There is a cultural and ethical shift in the tech industry towards consumer-focused innovations rather than addressing societal challenges.\n\t\t\t- Failure to invest in military technology could give adversaries an advantage in developing autonomous weapons.\n\t\t\t- Authors argue that the ethical debate should not prevent providing necessary technological support to military forces.\n\t-\n- ## Broader Tech Industry Support\n\t- Besides Palantir, companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Clearview AI contributed technology and services to Ukraine, enhancing cybersecurity, data management, and identification processes.\n\t- This collective effort underscores a broader trend of tech companies engaging directly in conflict zones, transforming Ukraine into a global tech R&D lab.\n\t- The collaboration is accelerating the integration of AI and autonomous systems in military operations, potentially redefining future warfare.\n\t- Ukraine's situation offers a unique testbed for new technologies, with real-time feedback loops for rapid innovation and deployment.\n- ## Ethical and Strategic Considerations\n\t- The involvement of private tech companies in warfare raises questions about legal, ethical, and privacy concerns, alongside the potential for technology proliferation to adversaries.\n\t- Palantir and other firms' contributions also spotlight the evolving role of the tech sector in national security, with companies acting as de facto defense partners.\n\t- More positively it can contribution to battle damage assessment in Ukraine using machine learning algorithms to analyse imagery and detect changes.\n- # What's already happening\n\t- {{renderer :linkpreview,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/03/israel-gaza-ai-database-hamas-airstrikes}}\n\t- [Autonomous F-16 Fighters Are ‘Roughly Even’ With Human Pilots Said Air Force Chief | The National Interest](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/autonomous-f-16-fighters-are-%E2%80%98roughly-even%E2%80%99-human-pilots-said-air-force-chief-210974)\n\t-\n- # What we can expect\n\t- The potential of AI to dominate warfare in the next decade, exacerbating issues of disinformation and misinformation.\n\t- The accessibility of AI tools for creating realistic content, enhancing the capabilities of bad actors in misinformation campaigns.\n\t- The critical need for investment in data infrastructure and preparation to counter the threats posed by AI in warfare.\n\t- The concept of deterrence in military thinking and how it might evolve with the advent of AI technologies.\n\t- The importance of data as a new form of ammunition in AI-driven warfare.\n\t- The mission of the speaker and like-minded technologists to leverage AI for improving national security and maintaining global stability.\n\t- The urgent call for more technologists to understand the critical nature of the current era and commit to supporting national security efforts.\n\t- Swarms of lethal drones equipped with facial recognition technology.\n\t- Unmanned armed robots that are nearly impossible to defeat.\n\t\t- {{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX0ji1sAXl8}}\n\t- Autonomous fighter jets capable of supersonic speeds and enduring greater gravitational forces than human pilots.\n\t- Cyberattacks aimed at disabling critical port infrastructure.\n\t- Disinformation campaigns and deepfakes that can manipulate presidential elections.\n\t- Foreign adversaries capable of disabling satellites, impairing global surveillance and communication.\n- # China vs The West\n\t- China ahead in computer vision AI and rapidly catching up in large language models.\n\t- China's military spending, especially in AI, dwarfing that of the United States.\n\t- The critical role of data in AI warfare, with the current underutilization of data from U.S. military assets being a significant disadvantage.\n\t- The reluctance of the U.S. tech industry to engage in government contracts, hindering AI advancements in defence.\n\t- China demands signoff and approval on all new [[Large language models]]\n\t- USA invokes defence production act to force cloud providers to monitor training, and asserts all USA training should notify the pentagon.

These platforms must negotiate unstructured terrain \n\t  and execute intricate actions such as maneuvering, scaling, and leaping – rendering traditional wheeled and \n\t  tracked designs inadequate,” added the team.\"\n\t  https://interestingengineering.com/military/robot-dogs-better-sharpshooters-study\n\t  ```\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
