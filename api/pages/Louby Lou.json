The goal is to move beyond simple videos to a real-time, AI-backed interactive experience.\n- **Key Features & Requirements Discussed:**\n- **Interactivity:** Crucial. Not just passive video consumption.\n- **\"No-Touch\" Interface:** Essential for hygiene in hospitals.\n- **AI-Backed:** For real-time interaction, safety, trust, and governance (awareness of EU AI Act).\n- **Motion Capture:** To translate real-life performance (specifically the user's \"clown doctor\" dance) into the digital realm.\n- **User Experience (UX):** Intuitive, accessible (scalable for different abilities), and engaging.\n- **Content:** Leverages the user's existing \"clown doctor\" persona and dance. The idea of an AI model overtrained on her dance videos to generate endless, stylized dance is a key technical proposal.\n- **Hardware for MVP:**\n\t- Portable, transparent, stick-on LED film display (safe, wipeable, relatively cheap).\n\t- Pixel streaming from a central GPU (for training the AI and serving content) to low-cost units at locations.\n- **Context-Awareness:** Potential for the system to know about weather, outside world etc.\n  \n  **Business & Strategy (using Lean Canvas & Pitch Deck frameworks):**\n- **Problem:** Stress, boredom, overwhelm for children (especially autistic) in hospitals or waiting situations, leading to over-medicalization or difficulties with procedures.\n- **Target Audience:**\n\t- Initially: Hospitals (especially high-end or specialist ones).\n\t- Pivoted towards: A broader market for a \"companion app\" (parents, schools, local authorities for quiet zones, entertainers, festivals). The age group of 3-10 years is identified as a starting focus for comprehensibility and ethical research.\n- **Unique Value Proposition (UVP):** \"Modern magic based on tradition,\" leveraging the user's generational clowning history, established NHS/international contacts, and unique dance style.\n- **Revenue Model:**\n\t- Short-term MVP: Selling a physical, portable interactive display unit on-site after a performance.\n\t- Long-term: Subscription service for a companion app.\n- **Channels:** Physical marketing/demos for institutions, online marketing via charities/professionals for the app.\n- **Funding Goal:** The immediate aim is to secure funding for research, UX design, a demonstrator/MVP, and primary testing, rather than a full market launch. The project needs to show \"clear growth potential.\" A budget of ~£15k for the initial tech loadout is mentioned.\n  \n  **Key Decisions & Insights:**\n- The \"companion app\" direct to consumers is likely more scalable and economically viable long-term than just hospital subscriptions.\n- However, the immediate MVP should be a tangible, sellable physical unit (the transparent LED display system) that the user can deploy in her existing practice. This is less fraught with AI governance risks for initial funding.\n- The \"unfair advantage\" lies in the user's unique personal history, performance style, and existing network.\n- A recent research paper on AI-generated dance from video offers a cutting-edge technical path for the interactive dance component.\n  \n  **Action Items:**\n- **User (Lucy Wilkinson):**\n\t- Develop the marketing narrative (backward/forward story, pitch).\n\t- Compile her dance videos (from YouTube etc.) for the AI model training.\n\t- Refine the MVP concept to best suit her needs and be easily deployable/sellable.\n- **Facilitator/Team:**\n\t- Conduct a research piece on the AI dance model and transparent LED tech.\n\t- Develop a contact list for partnerships and support.\n\t- Build out the team description for the funding bid.\n\t- Prepare a tech demo/proof-of-concept.\n- **Hayden (Animator):** Character building for the digital persona.\n- Below is a **drop-in update pack** you can paste straight into the Innovate UK portal (or the working Markdown we’re using) to bring every finance-, risk- and timetable-related section fully in line with the £50 k target and the new technical scope.\n  \n  ---\n- ## 🔄 Which form sections change?\n  \n  | PDF / portal section                  | What to replace or add                                                                                                          |\n  | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n  | **Q7 – Project**                      | Briefly mention use of LoRA-MDM diffusion fine-tuning for real-time dance stylisation (see “Technical feasibility” note below). |\n  | **Q8 – Impact & added value**         | Add bullet on “£50 k hardware + AI demonstrator enables UK supply-chain for transparent LED paediatric displays.”               |\n  | **Q9 – Resources**                    | Swap provisional roles table for the one below (adds Haydn’s rigging work, John’s model fine-tune, 5 G admin link, etc.).       |\n  | **Q10 – Work packages, costs & risk** | Replace WP table, cost summary, risk register and timeline with the versions supplied here.                                     |\n  | **Finance portal**                    | Enter the totals shown in **Finance roll-up**;

we’ll mitigate by adopting LoRA-MDM’s latent-consistency variant or short look-ahead buffering.\n  2. **GPU load** – the chosen RTX 4070 Super sustains >40 FPS for ≤1 s diffusion hops; if load spikes we drop to 30 FPS or cache idle‐dance loops.\n  \n  ---\n- ## ⚠️ Re-worked risk register\n  \n  | ID | Risk                                       |  P  |  I  | Score | Mitigation                                                                |\n  | -- | ------------------------------------------ | :-: | :-: | :---: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n  | R1 | Transparent-LED panel lead-time slips      |  🟡 |  🟠 |   🟠  | Get quotation + ex-stock confirmation before award;
