This is achieved through an innovative application\n  of the Apple Vision Pro AR headset.\n- In the VisionFlow: Connect system, the director, located remotely, wears\n  an AR headset and navigates along a marked line. This line mirrors the\n  inward-facing edge of a large-scale, wrap-around LED virtual production\n  facility. Within the LED volume, participants can view the director’s\n  avatar, providing a sense of spatial consistency and our work\n  interaction, crucial for effective direction.\n- A novel technique, \"ghost frame\" by Helios, is employed to prevent the\n  camera within the LED volume from capturing the director’s remote avatar\n  on the LED wall. This ensures the director’s virtual presence doesn’t\n  interfere with the recorded footage.\n- The benefits of VisionFlow: Connect are multifold. It allows senior\n  stakeholders to manage their time more efficiently as they can direct\n  remotely without needing to be physically present on multiple sets.\n  Directors can interact in real-time, giving instantaneous feedback and\n  adjustments. It also enhances directors’ spatial awareness of the scene,\n  thereby improving the decision-making process.\n- bfSlide 1: Title bfSlide 2: Problem  \n  \"VisionFlow: Revolutionizing Virtual Production with AI and\n  Telecollaboration\" \"The current ICVFX workflow is time-consuming,\n  costly, and requires specialized software knowledge.
