For instance the ideal meeting size is 6, and this is naturally established in work settings. This has not translated into a metaverse setting where dozens of people routinely crash across one another. In the context of supporting a creative “backstage” world where set planning, production shots, etc can be discussed we believe we have solutions which will get the best out of distributed teams of film-makers. Leveraging the world’s most powerful decentralised computing network to create scale and security without high cost The Bitcoin network is more than just a speculative money like asset, it is the most secure distributed computing system ever built. We can jump on the back of this at almost no cost to enable scale for transfer of value, trust, and digital assets of provenance. Cryptographically assured end points With the cryptography tools provided through integration of the Bitcoin network we can also use non-blockchain based secure messaging, and identity proofs. Micro transactions in collaborative spaces New tooling the space allows fractions of a pound or dollar to be exchanged between parties across the world. This means that work can be paid “by the second” both inside and outside of the metaverse. This radically improves creative microtask workflows. World leading open source machine learning and bot architectures By integrating Stablity AI tools for image generation, video processing, natural language, and speech to text / text to speech we hope to reduce friction within the backstage worlds. Creating a narrative arrow from a remote director/producer/DP, through a VP screen into a shoot, and back into a persistent metaverse shared with the public By linking across these new systems with world class telepresence research we hope to use a single digital context to support senior stakeholders, creatives, technical teams, and the wider public. New paths to monetisation and digital ownership This unified digital back end is optimised for flows of money, trust, and digital objects. This is a new area for VP.
