It was based on interviews and discussions with former Facebook employees and experts, shedding light on the company's internal dynamics and decision-making processes.\n- ## Zuckerberg’s New Goal: Creating Artificial General Intelligence\n\t- **Date:** 18/01/2024\n\t- **Key Points:**\n\t\t- [[Mark Zuckerberg]] and Meta aim to develop AGI, aligning AI research with generative AI product teams.\n\t\t- Intense competition for AI talent; Meta heavily investing in computing resources like Nvidia GPUs.\n\t\t- AGI lacks a clear definition; seen as a gradual process with diverse capabilities.\n\t\t- Meta's AI advancements: Llama 2 and upcoming Llama 3 models focus on coding, reasoning, and planning.\n\t\t- Debate on open vs. closed AI: Zuckerberg prefers open-source AI, balancing opportunity and safety.\n\t\t- AI's role in Meta's strategy: Enhancing social media and developing the metaverse.\n\t\t- Future vision: Deepening human-AI interaction in virtual worlds and social media.\n-\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
