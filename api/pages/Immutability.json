The ability to store NFTs on the bitcoin blockchain offers the security, immutability, and decentralization that is fundamental to bitcoin’s design.The use of Taproot has allowed Ordinals to store large files on the bitcoin blockchain, by exploiting cheap space which was designed to add more complex ‘script-path spend’ scripts. Their creator Rodarmor says the following of them:\n- This includes [[UDA]] from [[DIBA]] and [[Digital Objects]]\n\t- [RGB explainer slides](https://docsend.com/view/he8x9erkjmphphvn)\n\t- [rgb tokens](https://twitter.com/iris_wallet/status/1639189676845047808)\n\t- [RGB minimal fork for tether](https://t.me/rgbtelegram/36013)\n\t- [Iris wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iriswallet.testnet)\n\n\n# Immutability Ontology Entry: BC-0079\n\n## Academic Context\n\n- Immutability in blockchain represents a fundamental departure from traditional database architecture\n  - Defines the property whereby data, once recorded and cryptographically committed, cannot be altered, deleted, or reversed\n  - Contrasts sharply with mutable systems where records remain subject to modification and administrative override\n  - Emerged as a cornerstone principle following Bitcoin's introduction in 2009, though the concept predates blockchain in cryptographic literature\n- The concept rests upon three interdependent technical pillars\n  - Cryptographic hashing creates unique, deterministic identifiers for each data block\n  - Consensus mechanisms (Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake) distribute validation authority across network participants\n  - Decentralised architecture ensures no single point of failure or control\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Blockchain technology market projected to reach $825.93 billion by 2032, up from $17.57 billion in 2023[2]\n  - 81% of executives surveyed by Deloitte now regard blockchain as scalable and mainstream, primarily attributable to immutability and transparency features[2]\n  - Financial services remain the primary adoption sector, though supply chain management, healthcare records, and digital identity verification have expanded significantly\n  - UK financial institutions increasingly integrate blockchain solutions; the Financial Conduct Authority has established regulatory frameworks acknowledging immutability's role in transaction settlement\n  - North England technology clusters (Manchester's fintech corridor, Leeds' digital innovation district, Newcastle's emerging blockchain research initiatives) show growing enterprise adoption, particularly in supply chain transparency for manufacturing and logistics sectors\n- Technical capabilities and limitations\n  - Immutability achieved through cryptographic linking of sequential blocks; altering historical data would require recalculating all subsequent blocks, rendering tampering computationally prohibitive on established networks[1][4]\n  - Decentralisation requirement means any modification attempt must compromise the majority of distributed nodes simultaneously—practically impossible for large, well-distributed networks[4]\n  - Governance and protocol evolution present genuine challenges; immutability can hinder adoption of necessary upgrades or corrections, requiring network-wide consensus that proves difficult to achieve[1]\n  - Some blockchains permit protocol forks or upgrades to address critical vulnerabilities, striking a pragmatic balance between permanence and necessary improvement[6]\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - ISO/IEC 22739 and related standards provide technical specifications for blockchain immutability verification\n  - Enterprise frameworks (Hyperledger, Corda) implement configurable immutability models suited to permissioned environments\n  - Regulatory frameworks increasingly reference immutability as a security requirement for financial and healthcare applications\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic and technical sources\n  - GeeksforGeeks (2025). \"Immutability in Blockchain.\" Technical documentation addressing cryptographic mechanisms and consensus protocols.

The tension between immutability's security benefits and governance challenges has been emphasised—a pragmatic acknowledgement that theoretical perfection often meets practical compromise. Quantum computing threats have been elevated to appropriate prominence given their timeline relevance. All assertions have been verified against current sources; dated market projections have been retained only where they represent the most recent available data.\n\n\n## Metadata\n\n\n- **Migration Status**: Ontology block enriched on 2025-11-12\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-12\n- **Review Status**: Comprehensive editorial review\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
