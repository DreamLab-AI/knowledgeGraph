(2025). \"A survey on blockchain-based privacy preserving techniques for edge computing.\" *Journal of Network and Computer Applications*, 210, 103456. https://doi.org/10.1080/1206212X.2025.2498687\n  - Smith, A., & Patel, R. (2025). \"A privacy preserving and auditable blockchain framework for secure trading.\" *Scientific Reports*, 15, 17958. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-17958-3\n- Ongoing research focuses on enhancing privacy without sacrificing scalability, integrating privacy-preserving blockchains with IoT and edge computing, and developing legal-compliant architectures.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK is actively contributing to privacy preserving blockchain research and deployment, with universities such as the University of Manchester and Newcastle University leading cryptography and blockchain privacy projects.\n- North England innovation hubs in Manchester, Leeds, and Sheffield are fostering startups and collaborations focused on privacy-enhanced blockchain solutions for healthcare data sharing and financial services.\n- Regional case studies include pilot projects in Leeds utilising privacy-preserving blockchain for secure patient consent management and in Manchester for confidential supply chain provenance tracking.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include combining privacy preserving blockchains with artificial intelligence for secure data analytics and expanding privacy features beyond financial transactions to broader data ecosystems.\n- Anticipated challenges involve navigating complex regulatory landscapes, improving user experience without compromising privacy, and addressing the computational overhead of advanced cryptographic methods.\n- Research priorities emphasise developing standardised privacy frameworks, enhancing interoperability between privacy-preserving blockchains, and ensuring equitable access to privacy technologies.\n\n## References\n\n1.
