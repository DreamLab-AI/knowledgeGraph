This process applies established ethical frameworks (consequentialist, deontological, virtue ethics, care ethics, justice frameworks) to assess AI systems, identifying potential harms, benefits, rights violations, and value conflicts. The review process typically follows defined stages: proposal submission with system description and ethical self-assessment, initial screening to determine review level (exempt, expedited, full review) based on risk classification, expert deliberation by AI ethics board or review committee analyzing ethical implications across fairness, privacy, autonomy, safety, and accountability dimensions, stakeholder consultation soliciting affected community perspectives, ethical decision-making producing approval, conditional approval, deferral, or rejection with documented rationale, and ongoing monitoring of deployed systems with periodic re-review. Review criteria assess alignment with responsible AI principles, adequacy of fairness and bias mitigation measures, transparency and explainability provisions, human oversight mechanisms, privacy protection safeguards, safety and security controls, stakeholder engagement quality, and availability of redress mechanisms. The process draws methodological inspiration from research ethics review (Institutional Review Boards, Research Ethics Committees) and technology assessment approaches, adapted for AI-specific challenges. Implementation appears in organizational AI governance frameworks and is referenced in standards including IEEE P7000 series on ethically aligned design, ISO/IEC 42001 AI management systems, and EU AI Act governance requirements for high-risk systems.\n    - maturity:: mature\n    - source:: [[IEEE P7000]], [[ISO/IEC 42001:2023]], [[EU AI Act]]\n    - authority-score:: 0.95\n\n  - **Semantic Classification**\n    - owl:class:: aigo:EthicalReviewProcess\n    - owl:physicality:: VirtualEntity\n    - owl:role:: Process\n    - owl:inferred-class:: aigo:VirtualProcess\n    - belongsToDomain:: [[AIEthicsDomain]]\n    - implementedInLayer:: [[ConceptualLayer]]\n\n  - #### Relationships\n    id:: 0393-ethical-review-process-relationships\n\n  - #### OWL Axioms\n    id:: 0393-ethical-review-process-owl-axioms\n    collapsed:: true\n    - ```clojure\n      (Declaration (Class :EthicalReviewProcess))\n(SubClassOf :EthicalReviewProcess :EthicsReview)\n\n(SubClassOf :EthicalReviewProcess\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :evaluates :AISystem))\n(SubClassOf :EthicalReviewProcess\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :applies :EthicalFramework))\n(SubClassOf :EthicalReviewProcess\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :involves :ExpertDeliberation))\n(SubClassOf :EthicalReviewProcess\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :requires :StakeholderConsultation))\n(SubClassOf :EthicalReviewProcess\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :produces :EthicalReviewDecision))\n(SubClassOf :EthicalReviewProcess\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :ensures :GovernanceCompliance))\n\n(SubClassOf :EthicalReviewProcess\n  (ObjectIntersectionOf\n    (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :conducted_by :AIEthicsBoard)\n    (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :documents :ReviewOutcome)))\n      ```\n\n- ## About 0393 Ethical Review Process\n  id:: 0393-ethical-review-process-about\n\n  - \n  -\n  \n\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
