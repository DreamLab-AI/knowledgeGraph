(2013). *Information Propagation in the Bitcoin Network*. IEEE P2P. DOI: 10.1109/P2P.2013.6688709\n- Ongoing research directions:\n  - Reducing propagation latency without compromising decentralisation.\n  - Game-theoretical analyses of miner incentives under varying propagation delays.\n  - Novel network topologies and cryptographic techniques to enhance block dissemination efficiency.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- British contributions:\n  - UK universities, including the University of Manchester and Newcastle University, contribute to blockchain network research, focusing on propagation efficiency and security.\n  - UK-based startups integrate advanced propagation protocols to support fintech and supply chain applications.\n- North England innovation hubs:\n  - Leeds Blockchain Lab explores scalable blockchain infrastructure with emphasis on low-latency communication.\n  - Sheffield’s Digital Institute investigates blockchain’s role in regional smart city initiatives, leveraging efficient block propagation.\n- Regional case studies:\n  - Pilot projects in Manchester employ blockchain for secure, real-time data sharing in healthcare, relying on rapid block propagation to maintain data integrity.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends:\n  - Integration of AI-driven network optimisation to dynamically adjust propagation strategies.\n  - Expansion of Layer 1 protocol enhancements to support sub-second block times.\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Balancing block size increases with propagation speed to avoid centralisation pressures.\n  - Mitigating network partition risks in geographically dispersed nodes, including those in the UK.\n- Research priorities:\n  - Developing standardised metrics for propagation performance across diverse blockchain networks.\n  - Investigating hybrid consensus models that reduce reliance on rapid block propagation without sacrificing security.\n\n## References\n\n1.
