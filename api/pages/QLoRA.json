QLoRA uses NormalFloat4 quantisation, double quantisation, and paged optimisers to achieve extreme memory efficiency whilst maintaining performance.\n\n\n## Academic Context\n\n- QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter) is an advanced fine-tuning technique for large language models (LLMs) that combines 4-bit quantisation with low-rank adaptation to reduce memory and computational demands.\n  - It builds on the foundational LoRA method, which fine-tunes models by training small, low-rank adapter matrices while freezing the original model weights.\n  - QLoRA introduces NormalFloat4 (NF4) quantisation, double quantisation of quantisation constants, and paged optimisers to enable fine-tuning of very large models (65 billion parameters and above) on consumer-grade GPUs without significant performance loss.\n  - The academic foundation lies in efficient parameter adaptation and quantisation theory, balancing model size reduction with accuracy retention.\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption of QLoRA has expanded due to its ability to fine-tune massive LLMs efficiently, making it accessible beyond large-scale data centres.\n  - Organisations deploying LLMs for customised applications increasingly prefer QLoRA for its low memory footprint and fast training cycles.\n  - Platforms supporting QLoRA include open-source frameworks and commercial AI providers, enabling fine-tuning of models like GPT-3, GPT-4, LLaMA, and Falcon.\n- Technical capabilities:\n  - QLoRA reduces GPU memory requirements drastically (e.g., from over 780GB to under 48GB for 65B parameter models) without degrading predictive performance.\n  - It achieves this through 4-bit NF4 quantisation, double quantisation of constants, and paged optimisers that offload optimizer states to CPU memory when GPU memory is constrained.\n- Limitations:\n  - While highly efficient, QLoRA’s performance depends on the quality of quantisation and adapter design; some niche tasks may still require full fine-tuning.\n  - Hardware compatibility and software support for paged optimisers and quantisation schemes can vary.\n- Standards and frameworks:\n  - QLoRA is increasingly integrated into machine learning libraries supporting parameter-efficient fine-tuning and quantisation-aware training.\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers and sources:\n  - Dettmers, T., et al.
