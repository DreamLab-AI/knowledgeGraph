G. (2023). Chain of Custody. *StatPearls*. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551677/  \n    - Comprehensive overview of chain of custody principles and forensic importance.\n  - Akansha (2025). Digital Chain of Custody. *International Journal of Advanced Forensic and Applied Medical Research*, 6(2), 45-53.  \n    - Discusses systematic documentation and control of digital assets in forensic contexts.\n- Ongoing research focuses on:\n  - Enhancing cryptographic methods for sealing evidence\n  - Leveraging blockchain for immutable audit trails\n  - Improving automation and AI-assisted verification of custody logs\n  - Addressing privacy and data protection challenges in evidence handling\n\n## UK Context\n\n- British contributions include the Home Office’s Digital Evidence Strategy, which promotes standardisation and innovation in digital forensic processes.\n- North England innovation hubs, notably in Manchester and Leeds, have fostered collaborations between universities, police forces, and tech companies to develop advanced digital evidence management tools.\n- Regional case studies demonstrate successful deployment of chain of custody systems in complex cybercrime investigations, highlighting the importance of localised expertise and infrastructure.\n- Sheffield and Newcastle police forces have piloted blockchain-based custody logging with promising results, although full-scale adoption remains a work in progress.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends:\n  - Integration of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies for tamper-proof custody records.\n  - Use of AI and machine learning to detect anomalies or potential breaches in custody chains.\n  - Expansion of cloud-based evidence management platforms with enhanced security and accessibility.\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Balancing transparency with privacy and data protection regulations (e.g., UK GDPR).\n  - Ensuring interoperability across diverse forensic tools and agencies.\n  - Managing the exponential growth of digital evidence volume without compromising chain integrity.\n- Research priorities include:\n  - Developing standardised protocols for emerging digital evidence types (IoT, cloud data).\n  - Enhancing user-friendly interfaces for custody documentation to reduce human error.\n  - Evaluating legal admissibility of novel custody technologies in UK courts.\n\n## References\n\n1.
