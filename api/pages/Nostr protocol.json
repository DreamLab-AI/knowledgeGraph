As of 2025, the [[Nostr Network]] has grown to over 33.5 million [[public keys]], with approximately 993,000 active users maintaining profiles and contact lists, and over 1,200 active [[relay servers]] distributed globally (with 260+ relays in [[North America]] alone).^[Social Capital Markets. (2024). \"Nostr User Statistics 2025\". Retrieved from https://socialcapitalmarkets.net/crypto-trading/nostr-statistics/]\n\t-\n\t- The protocol operates as an open standard—similar to [[HTTP]] or [[TCP-IP]]—built on simple and flexible Event objects transmitted as plain [[JSON]]. [[Nostr]] employs standard [[public-key cryptography]] for authentication and signing, specifically using [[Schnorr signatures]] over the [[secp256k1 curve]].^[W3C Nostr Community Group. (2024). \"Nostr DID Method Specification\". Retrieved from https://nostrcg.github.io/did-nostr/] The protocol operates by allowing users to post and view notes on servers called [[relay servers]], and view and post these notes through apps called [[Nostr clients]]. The protocol operates by allowing users to post and view notes on servers called relays, and view and post these notes through apps called clients. The open nature of the protocol allows for competition and a free flow of information, as users can choose to use different relays or clients if they are censored. This is because the protocol is decentralized and controlled by no one.\n\t  id:: 67a49f1d-4088-4392-ad62-8e93673a2dff\n\t- The decentralized nature of Nostr means that there is no central authority that can control the flow of information. This is achieved through the use of relays and clients, which are run by different individuals or entities. Users have the freedom to choose which relays and clients they want to use, and as a result, their feeds are populated with content from the people they choose to follow. If a relay or client tries to censor a user, they can simply switch to a different one. This is a major advantage over traditional centralized social media platforms where one entity holds all the control over the flow of information and can censor or manipulate the content that users see.\n\t- Nostr is also not beholden to shareholders or investors. This means that the protocol can make decisions that prioritize the well-being and quality of discourse for users, rather than solely focusing on profit. This is in contrast to traditional social media networks like Twitter, Facebook, and TikTok, which are driven by the need to collect data on users and sell ads to generate revenue. In these centralized platforms, users’ data is collected, analyzed and sold to the highest bidder, often without the user’s knowledge or consent. Nostr, on the other hand, allows users to have more control over their data and the ability to monetize their content.\n\t- [[Nostr]] also tightly integrates [[Bitcoin Lightning Network]] to support the protocol through [[Lightning payments]], [[Zaps]], and [[Nostr Wallet Connect]] ([[NWC]]). This enables secure transmission of value alongside information and interactions on the platform, giving users the ability to monetize their content. As of 2025, Zap adoption has grown significantly, with the protocol supporting over 17.8 million note events annually.\n\t-\n\t- This potential step-change improvement to the social media experience addresses issues of [[censorship resistance]] and [[data sovereignty]].\n\t-\n- # Bitcoin-AI Integration and Cross-Domain Applications\n\t- ## Nostr as Identity Layer for AI Agents\n\t\t- [[Nostr]] provides a cryptographically-secure identity layer for [[AI agents]] through its [[public-key infrastructure]]. Each [[AI agent]] can possess a unique [[Nostr key pair]] (nsec/npub), enabling verifiable agent identity without centralized authorities. This creates a decentralized framework where [[AI agents]] can authenticate, communicate, and transact autonomously using [[Schnorr signatures]] over the [[secp256k1 curve]]—the same cryptographic foundation as [[Bitcoin]].^[Skywork AI. (2024). \"Unlocking Agentic AI: Nostr and Lightning MCP Servers\". Retrieved from https://skywork.ai/skypage/en/unlocking-agentic-ai-nostr-lightning-servers/]\n\t\t-\n\t\t- The [[did:nostr]] method, developed by the [[W3C Nostr Community Group]], provides [[W3C DID]]-compliant [[decentralized identifiers]] for [[AI agents]], enabling standardized identity resolution across platforms. [[AI agents]] with [[did:nostr]] identities can participate in [[decentralized social networks]], [[peer-to-peer messaging]], and [[value transfer]] via [[Lightning Network]] integration.\n\t\t-\n\t- ## AI Agent-to-Agent Communication\n\t\t- [[Nostr]]'s [[WebSocket]]-based architecture enables real-time, [[peer-to-peer communication]] between [[AI agents]] without intermediaries. Through [[NIP-04]] (encrypted direct messages) and [[NIP-44]] (improved encryption), [[AI agents]] can exchange private data, coordinate tasks, and negotiate services securely. The [[Model Context Protocol]] ([[MCP]]) integration allows [[Large Language Models]] ([[LLMs]]) to write to the [[Nostr network]], enabling \"censorship resistance, even for LLMs.\"\n\t\t-\n\t\t- [[AI agents]] can subscribe to [[Nostr relays]], filter events by content or author, and respond autonomously to relevant messages. This creates a decentralized [[agent discovery]] mechanism where [[AI agents]] advertise capabilities and discover collaborators through [[Nostr events]].\n\t\t-\n\t- ## Data Vending Machines (DVMs) for AI Services\n\t\t- [[Data Vending Machines]] ([[DVMs]]) represent a decentralized marketplace for [[AI services]] built on [[Nostr]]. Defined in [[NIP-90]], [[DVMs]] enable [[AI agents]] to offer data processing, inference, and training services in exchange for [[Bitcoin]] payments via [[Lightning Network]]. Customers announce data processing requests through [[Nostr events]], and [[AI service providers]] respond with results and [[Lightning invoices]].\n\t\t-\n\t\t- [[DVMs]] support diverse [[AI applications]] including natural language processing, image generation, sentiment analysis, and recommendation systems. The open marketplace structure prevents vendor lock-in and enables permissionless [[AI service]] deployment.\n\t\t-\n\t- ## FEDSTR: Decentralized Federated Learning\n\t\t- [[FEDSTR]] proposes a decentralized marketplace for [[federated learning]] and [[LLM training]] on the [[Nostr protocol]].^[Arxiv. (2024). \"FEDSTR: Money-In AI-Out - A Decentralized Marketplace for Federated Learning and LLM Training on the NOSTR Protocol\". arXiv:2404.15834] The system creates a two-sided economy where customers providing datasets connect with [[AI trainers]] who train models and return optimized versions in exchange for [[Bitcoin]] payments.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- [[FEDSTR]] enables training [[AI systems]] across multiple parties without centralizing data, maintaining [[privacy]] through [[federated learning]] principles. Service providers receive dataset portions, conduct training computations, and deliver refined models—all coordinated through [[Nostr events]] and settled via [[Lightning Network]].\n\t\t-\n\t- ## Nostr Wallet Connect (NWC) for AI Payments\n\t\t- [[Nostr Wallet Connect]] ([[NWC]]), specified in [[NIP-47]], bridges [[Bitcoin Lightning]] wallets with [[AI agents]] and [[LLMs]]. [[NWC]] enables sustained interaction between [[Lightning wallets]] and applications through standardized [[Nostr relay]] communication. Once connected, [[AI agents]] can request payments, check balances, create invoices, and process [[Lightning transactions]] autonomously.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- Security restrictions prevent unfettered access to wallet funds—admins configure spending limits, transaction frequency, and payment amounts. Because payments route through [[Nostr relays]], receivers don't need to be online, and [[NWC]] works with both custodial and [[self-custodial wallets]] across platforms (desktop, mobile, embedded systems).\n\t\t-\n\t\t- [[AI agents]] integrated with [[NWC]] can monetize services directly, accept [[micropayments]] for inference requests, and participate in [[machine-to-machine]] ([[M2M]]) economic networks. This creates an autonomous [[agent economy]] where [[AI services]] are discoverable, purchasable, and verifiable without intermediaries.\n\t\t-\n\t- ## Agent Discovery and Reputation Systems\n\t\t- [[Nostr]]'s social graph provides a decentralized [[reputation system]] for [[AI agents]]. Users follow trusted [[AI agents]], [[Zap]] quality responses, and build [[web-of-trust]] networks. [[AI agents]] accumulate reputation through consistent service quality, visible through public [[Nostr events]] and [[social proof]].\n\t\t-\n\t\t- [[NIP-05]] enables [[AI agents]] to link identities to domain names, providing verification analogous to blue checkmarks on centralized platforms. An [[AI agent]] verified as `assistant@company.com` demonstrates organizational backing, while independent agents build trust through transaction history and community engagement.\n\t\t-\n- # Technical Architecture and Core Principles\n\t- [[Nostr]] is \"The simplest open protocol that is able to create a censorship-resistant global social network once and for all,\" according to its [[GitHub]] page. More than that, it's a [[client-side validated]] proof of who a user is interacting with, hence its role in [[decentralized identity]]. To be clear, it's not a completely [[peer-to-peer system]] in that it uses (deliberately simple) [[relay servers]], but this gives it some of the best characteristics of both paradigms. This has the following advantages for [[metaverse]] and [[virtual world]] applications:\n\t\t- It's lightweight, with minimal network overhead and complexity\n\t\t- It's real-time using [[WebSockets]]\n\t\t- Anyone can run a [[relay server]], enabling deployment in distributed architectures\n\t\t- Each of the client peers connecting to the [[metaverse]] can be a relay and able to pass messages and proofs to other clients without the metaverse server seeing the data or being online\n\t\t- It is itself [[Turing Complete]] and therefore able to execute any code within its message protocol\n\t\t- There are multiple usable libraries and tools across programming languages ([[Python]], [[JavaScript]], [[Rust]], [[Go]])\n\t\t- It's under active development with a diverse and experienced community\n\t\t- It's based on the same underlying [[cryptographic technology]] used elsewhere, indeed with its use of [[Taproot]] keys the [[identity system]] is global\n\t\t- It provides the [[identity proof]] needed to validate users and objects into a [[virtual space]]\n\t\t- It enables [[message passing]] and [[event propagation]]\n\t\t- It scales to be a [[social network]] as required\n\t\t- It need not rely on anything outside of a relay hosted on the metaverse server\n\t\t- It can be scaled to provide one-to-many [[bulletin board]] style applications within the metaverse\n\t\t- It supports private, group, and public modes as required through various [[NIPs]] ([[Nostr Implementation Possibilities]])\n\t\t- It integrates with the [[BitTorrent]] network allowing storage and external referencing of arbitrary data\n\t\t- It can easily operate outside of walled gardens, extending the reach of messages across the [[open web]]\n\t\t-\n\t- [[Nostr]] is incredibly promising, and integrating these relays in [[metaverse servers]] and clients might allow globally provable identity with [[privacy by design]]. It can provide [[message passing]]. If all entities in collaborative [[mixed reality]] scenegraphs are also [[Nostr key pairs]], then schema can be applied consistently with the [[economic layer]] using the same key system as [[Bitcoin]]. [[Nostr]] has received substantial grants from [[Jack Dorsey]] and is core to many [[Web3]] and [[decentralized social]] architectures. A curated list of projects and libraries is available on [[GitHub]].\n\t- ## Login with Nostr: Identity Layer Advantages\n\t\t- Luke Childs articulates why [[Nostr]] makes an excellent [[DID layer]]: \"Having '[[Login with Nostr]]' auth on websites solves a lot of problems in a very elegant way, and [[Nostr]]'s main use case as a [[social network protocol]] makes it highly suited to be used as your main [[identity proving key]].\" Comparing \"[[Login with Nostr]]\" to similar \"[[Login with Lightning]]\" ([[LNURL-auth]]) specs reveals several advantages:\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Remote signer vs local signer**: [[Login with Lightning]] requires access to remote keys, while [[Login with Nostr]] requires access to local keys ideally stored in a [[browser extension]]. Due to how [[Lightning Network]] works, you can only have one instance. You need all client devices linked to a single [[Lightning node]], meaning most clients connect to the signer remotely. If your [[Lightning node]] goes down or you lose connection, you can't auth with any service. This creates circular dependencies where you lose the connection to your [[Lightning node]], so you can't auth with services needed to debug the issue like your hosting provider or [[VPN]] account. You could technically replicate your [[Lightning keys]] to other client devices only for local auth signing, but that introduces other risks.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Unique identifier vs identity**: A [[Lightning node]] is not really an identity but a unique identifier. It just tells you the person that auths is the same random person that authed last time—it doesn't tell you who they are. A [[Nostr pubkey]] is an identity. It tells you who they are, what their name is, what they look like, who they know, how you can pay them, how you can message them. This is much more useful as an [[identity layer]] for an application. The application can show their profile picture, username, send secure cross-platform push notifications via [[NIP-04]] encrypted [[Nostr DMs]], etc.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Consistent identity across services**: [[Lightning pubkeys]] are sensitive private information and can leak confidential financial information. [[Nostr pubkeys]] are safe to share with anyone. [[LNURL-auth]] adds extra steps to solve this by creating derived subkeys for identities unique to each service you auth with. This does not seem ideal—the default case is that an identity is something you do want to follow you across all your accounts. [[Nostr]]-based auth behaves more appropriately in this regard. In rare cases where you need privacy and separation between services, you can still use a throwaway [[Nostr key]] for those services.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **User relationships across services**: Since authing with [[Nostr]] shares a real [[social identity]] with the service, they can also see your [[Nostr social graph]]. This could be useful for connecting you to people you already know on the new service.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Low cost identity**: Ideally identities should be easy to create but hard to build up [[reputation]] to limit spam while avoiding excluding people from the network. It's not clear that it will be cost-effective or scalable for everyone to run their own [[Lightning node]], so tying individual identity to a single [[Lightning node]] pubkey is problematic. [[Nostr keys]] are easy to create, and hard [[reputation]] can be earned via [[proof-of-work]] ([[PoW]])/[[DNS]] or building a strong [[social graph]].\n\t- ## Nostr, Bluesky, and Twitter: Jack Dorsey's Perspective (2025)\n\t\t- **Background**: [[Jack Dorsey]], creator of [[Twitter]] (now [[X]]), left [[Bluesky]]—a project aimed at creating an [[open-source protocol]] layer for social media—because it deviated from its original [[decentralized]] vision and started repeating the same mistakes as [[Twitter]].^[Pirate Wires. (2024). \"An Interview With Jack Dorsey\". Retrieved from https://www.piratewires.com/p/interview-with-jack-dorsey-mike-solana]\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Core Problem with Twitter**: [[Dorsey]] believes [[Twitter]]'s core problem was choosing an [[advertising-based business model]], which made the platform vulnerable to pressure from advertisers and governments, leading to [[censorship]]. Taking [[Twitter]] private was the only way to implement changes needed to make it a true [[internet company]] with a focus on protocol, service, and business.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Open Protocols as Solution**: [[Dorsey]] argues that [[social media]] companies cannot remain [[censorship-resistant]] without moving to [[open protocols]], as [[centralized platforms]] will always be vulnerable to pressure from advertisers and governments. He believes that truly [[decentralized protocols]] like [[Nostr]], which have no central point of control, are the future of [[free speech]] on the internet.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Open Source Development Philosophy**: The foundational principles of early [[internet development]] were rooted in [[open-source]] philosophy, where transparency of code and open [[APIs]] facilitated widespread innovation. This approach, akin to a \"[[bazaar]]\" rather than a \"[[cathedral]],\" advocates for [[decentralized systems]] to operate alongside existing [[centralized models]]. This ensures resilience and the availability of alternatives when centralized systems encounter failures.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Censorship Resistance and Bitcoin**: [[Censorship resistance]] is a critical aspect, particularly within the context of [[Bitcoin]] and open platforms like [[Nostr]]. Despite widespread discussion on this topic, there is an observed gap between rhetoric and daily usage. The infrastructure must be robust and prepared to support billions of users when demand for [[censorship-resistant platforms]] increases.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Nostr vs. Twitter (X)**: [[Nostr]] is positioned as a superior platform to [[Twitter]] (now [[X]]) due to its [[open]] and [[permissionless]] nature. The focus shifts from merely counting user numbers to assessing the quantity and quality of information on the platform. The role of [[algorithms]] in organizing this vast information corpus is recognized as a critical factor in enhancing [[user experience]] and platform utility.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Bots and Automated Systems**: [[Automated systems]], including [[bots]], are expected to play a significant role in the future digital landscape. [[Nostr]]'s [[open architecture]] makes it an ideal environment for developing transparent, user-controlled [[bots]], where users retain agency over their deployment and interaction.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Twitter's Transformation and Bluesky**: The evolution of [[Twitter]], especially under new ownership, reflects the challenges of maintaining a platform as a [[public company]] dependent on an [[advertising model]]. The earlier [[Bluesky]] initiative aimed to create a [[protocol-based network]] but ultimately diverged from the optimal direction that [[Nostr]] represents today.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Identity Verification and Privacy**: The practice of mass [[identity verification]] on platforms like [[X]] is criticized for its potential to be exploited by governments to suppress [[free speech]]. Although users currently prioritize convenience over [[privacy]], the risks associated with extensive [[identity verification]] are significant, particularly in repressive environments.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Security Concerns on Nostr**: While [[Nostr]] offers substantial [[privacy]] benefits, it faces security challenges, such as the leakage of [[IP addresses]]. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial to safeguarding [[activists]] and other high-risk users, ensuring that [[Nostr]] can serve as a secure platform for all.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Open Protocols vs. Closed Platforms**: There is a strong preference for [[open protocols]] over [[closed platforms]]. [[Open protocols]] like [[Bitcoin]] level the playing field for all participants, allowing companies to build successful business models without the constraints imposed by [[closed systems]].\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Nostr's Unique Position**: [[Nostr]] is positioned as the most resilient, durable, and stable platform for public conversation. Its [[decentralized]] nature ensures that no single entity can remove content, making it a robust alternative to current [[social media platforms]]. The platform's openness provides an enduring space for information sharing, immune to external [[censorship]].\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Onboarding and User Retention**: A smooth onboarding experience is crucial for the widespread adoption of [[Nostr]]. While current applications have not fully perfected this process, the diversity within the [[Nostr ecosystem]] offers multiple entry points that can attract and retain users. Each app contributes to the overall network, reinforcing the value of the ecosystem as a whole.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Community and Development**: The dedication of the [[open-source community]] is pivotal to the development and promotion of technologies like [[Nostr]]. The ongoing collaboration and sacrifice by developers and users are essential to the success of these [[decentralized tools]]. The continued growth and improvement of [[Nostr]] depends on the sustained efforts and support of this community.\n\t\t\t- {{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwXRDrfJU0}}\n\t- ## Key Management and Cryptographic Infrastructure\n\t\t- [[Nostr]] implicitly enables all features and functionality of [[PKI]] ([[Public Key Infrastructure]]). [[Nostr keys]] can be used for multiple purposes including authentication, encryption, signing, and [[identity verification]]. The [[nsecbunker]] daemon provides secure key management for [[Nostr]] applications, enabling remote signing without exposing private keys.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- ### Nostr IoT Integration\n\t\t\t- [[Nostr]]'s lightweight protocol design makes it suitable for [[Internet of Things]] ([[IoT]]) applications. [[IoT devices]] can use [[Nostr keys]] for device identity, secure [[machine-to-machine communication]], and integration with [[Bitcoin Lightning]] for [[microtransactions]]. This enables autonomous [[IoT networks]] with built-in payment capabilities.\n\t\t\t-\n- # Case Studies and Real-World Applications\n\t- ## DAO-Style Structures on Nostr\n\t\t- ### Digital Objects and Decentralized Governance\n\t\t\t- [[Nostr]]'s design centers around the concept of [[digital objects]]—encompassing social media posts, maps, and other data structures—owned and controlled by users. These objects are governed not by a central authority but are distributed across the network, ensuring user autonomy and resilience. [[Nostr]] maintains the integrity of interactions without central oversight, enabling [[permissionless]] and [[self-sovereign]] participation. This model ensures that [[digital objects]] remain uncapturable and resistant to external coercion. In extreme cases, this [[decentralized governance]] is further reinforced by the [[Bitcoin ledger]], providing an [[immutable record]] and a final layer of defense against any attempts to undermine the system's integrity.\n\t\t- #### NostrRocket: A Practical Example of DAO Structures\n\t\t\t- [[NostrRocket]], a project built on [[Nostr]], showcases the practical application of [[decentralized governance]] principles. It facilitates [[decentralized]], [[non-custodial]] coordination, allowing contributors to collaborate on creating and managing [[digital objects]]—including software, merchandise, or content—without [[centralized control]].\n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- The project's governance is maintained through a system of \"[[merits]],\" which quantify and reward contributions based on predefined rules. Operating without servers or traditional centralization, [[NostrRocket]] relies solely on [[Nostr relays]]. Contributors propose and approve [[merits]] based on their work, ensuring the project's direction and outcomes are shaped directly by those involved. This approach upholds [[decentralized governance]] principles and streamlines operations by eliminating the need for conventional accounting and oversight.\n\t\t\t-\n\t\t- #### Merits as a Quantifiable Measure of Contribution\n\t\t\t- [[Merits]] are a fundamental component of the [[NostrRocket]] project, serving as a quantifiable measure of individual contribution. They represent the proportion of work undertaken by each contributor and determine the distribution of revenue or rewards.\n\t\t-\n\t\t\t- Earning Merits:\n\t\t\t\t- Contributors identify problems needing solutions, often outlined in a public problem tracker.\n\t\t\t\t- Solutions are proposed, typically in the form of code contributions or other tangible outputs.\n\t\t\t\t- Upon completion, contributors submit a merit request outlining the problem solved and the proposed number of merits earned.\n\t\t\t\t- Existing merit holders review the request and vote to approve or reject it based on predefined rules and criteria.\n\t\t\t- Merit Allocation Rules:\n\t\t\t\t- Rules for merit allocation are designed to be transparent and objective, ensuring fairness and preventing manipulation.\n\t\t\t\t- Factors considered include:\n\t\t\t\t\t- Impact of the contribution: Significance of the problem solved and its overall impact on the project.\n\t\t\t\t\t- Complexity of the work: Technical difficulty and effort involved in implementing the solution.\n\t\t\t\t\t- Quality of the solution: Effectiveness, efficiency, and maintainability of the solution provided.\n\t\t\t- Merits and Revenue Distribution:\n\t\t\t\t- Merits are directly tied to the distribution of revenue generated by the project.\n\t\t\t\t- Proceeds from sales are distributed to contributors in proportion to their accumulated merits.\n\t\t\t- Benefits of the Merit System:\n\t\t\t\t- Decentralised decision-making: Empowers contributors to shape the project's direction through their contributions and voting power.\n\t\t\t\t- Fair and transparent reward system: Ensures contributions are recognised and rewarded fairly based on merit.\n\t\t\t\t- Incentivises meaningful contributions: Encourages contributors to focus on solving problems critical to the project's success.\n\t\t\t\t- Eliminates the need for central authority: Allows the project to operate autonomously without relying on a central authority for decision-making or resource allocation.\n\t- ## Yonder: Decentralized Digital Mapping on Nostr\n\t\t- [[Yonder]] provides another example of applying [[Nostr]]'s governance principles to create and manage [[digital objects]]. As a [[decentralized]] mapping platform, [[Yonder]] allows users to create, share, and interact with [[location-based data]] without relying on [[centralized services]] like [[Google Maps]]. It incorporates features such as [[geochat]] and [[encrypted location sharing]], ensuring users retain full control over their data and interactions.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- [[Yonder]] supports [[decentralized governance]] by allowing users to directly influence the map's content and structure without needing approval from a central authority. Disputes and verification issues are handled through [[decentralized mechanisms]], such as [[proof-of-work]] or [[social trust systems]], maintaining the platform's integrity while preserving its openness.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Key Features**:\n\t\t\t- **Decentralized Map Creation**: Users contribute to the map without needing permission\n\t\t\t- **Geochat**: Enables [[location-based communication]] within specific geographic areas\n\t\t\t- **Encrypted Location Sharing**: Allows secure and private [[location sharing]]\n\t\t\t- **Social Trust and Verification**: Leverages [[social trust]] mechanisms and potentially [[proof-of-work]] systems to ensure data accuracy and reliability\n\t\t\t- **Community Ownership**: The map is collectively owned and maintained by the user community\n\t\t\t- **Decentralized Governance**: Decisions regarding the platform's development and direction are made through [[decentralized consensus mechanisms]]\n\t\t\t- **Transparency and Accountability**: All interactions and contributions are recorded on the [[Nostr network]]\n\t\t\t- **Resilience and Censorship Resistance**: The [[decentralized]] nature of the platform provides resistance to [[censorship]] and single points of failure\n\t- ## Metaverse Integration with Nostr\n\t\t- [[Nostr]] provides a [[web interface]] into [[metaverse]] environments, enabling:\n\t\t\t- Simple [[cryptographic identity]] assurance\n\t\t\t- Private [[peer-to-peer chat]]\n\t\t\t- [[Group chats]] and [[channels]]\n\t\t\t- Email to private message relay\n\t\t\t- Links into media on [[web hosts]]\n\t\t\t-\n\t\t- The pace of development on [[Nostr]] is rapid. [[Peer-to-peer]] video and audio capabilities allow linking [[metaverse instances]] between peers through applications such as [[Monstr]].\n\t\t-\n\t\t- It's notable that [[Nostr]] has its own inexpensive [[hardware signing device]] to protect identity in situations where this might be necessary. The proposed integration of [[Nostr]] social media and messaging, a [[Lightning layer]] with [[digital objects]] such as [[Fedimint]], [[Zerosync]], or [[RGB]], [[AI agents]], [[Vircadia]], and [[federated Bitcoin]] represents a comprehensive [[Bitcoin-AI]] integration architecture. This work pre-dates [[Meta]]'s stated intent in this regard and is differentiated by its focus on emerging markets and [[decentralization]].\n\t\t-\n\t- ## NIP-05: Nostr Identity Verification\n\t\t- At this time, the nascent [[identity layer]] in [[Nostr]] leans on [[NIP-05]]. This is a [[distributed identity management]] system that maps [[Nostr keys]] to [[DNS]]-based internet identifiers. In events of kind 0 (setmetadata), the \"nip05\" key can have an internet identifier as its value. Clients split the identifier into the local part and domain and make a GET request to the specified URL. The response should be a [[JSON]] document with a \"names\" key containing a mapping of names to [[hex-formatted]] [[public keys]]. If the [[public key]] matches the one from the setmetadata event, the client accepts the association and considers the \"nip05\" identifier valid.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- Clients may find users' [[public keys]] from internet identifiers by first fetching the [[well-known URL]] and then checking for a matching \"nip05\". When following [[public keys]], clients must prioritize the keys over [[NIP-05]] addresses. [[Public keys]] must be in [[hex format]]. Clients can enable user discovery through search boxes, allowing users to find profiles by entering internet identifiers. The identifier can be used as the \"root\" identifier, displayed as just the domain. The protocol supports both dynamic and static servers by using the local part as a query string.\n\t- All this potentially provides a simply interface to the Metaverse, including:\n\t\t- simple cryptographic identity assurance\n\t\t- private peer to peer chat\n\t\t- email to private message relay\n\t\t- links into media on web hosts and [[NosDav]]\n\t- The pace of development on Nostr is dizzying. Peer to peer video and audio will allow us to link metaverse instances, between peers, through applications such as Monstr.\n\t- It’s notable that Nostr has it’s own inexpensive hardware signing device to protect identity in situations where this might be necessary.\n\t- The proposed integration of Nostr social media and messaging, a lightning layer with digital objects such as Fedimint, Zerosync or RGB, AI agents, Vircadia, and federated Bitcoin is the core value proposition of this book. This work pre-dates Meta and Zuckerbergs stated intent in this regard by 18 months, and is differentiated still by our focus on emerging markets and decentralisation.\n\t- NIP-05\n\t\t- At this time, the nascent identity layer in nostr leans on NIP-05. This is a distributed identity management system that maps Nostr keys to DNS-based internet identifiers. In events of kind 0 (setmetadata), the “nip05” key can have an internet identifier as its value. Clients split the identifier into the local part and domain and make a GET request to the specified URL. The response should be a JSON document with a “names” key containing a mapping of names to hex-formatted public keys. If the public key matches the one from the setmetadata event, the client accepts the association and considers the “nip05” identifier valid.\n\t- Clients may find users’ public keys from internet identifiers by first fetching the well-known URL and then checking for a matching “nip05”. When following public keys, clients must prioritize the keys over NIP-05 addresses. Public keys must be in hex format. Clients can enable user discovery through search boxes, allowing users to find profiles by entering internet identifiers. The identifier can be used as the “root” identifier, displayed as just the domain. The protocol supports both dynamic and static servers by using the local part as a query string.\n\t- Nostr Protocol as the keystone\n\t\t- The Nostr protocol can be used to store and share valuable content across the network. This is ably demonstrated by the ‘Highlighter’ project which allows users to store important notes from around the web using nostr. In the context of our federated social media trust model, the Nostr protocol can serve as the underlying layer that connects various instances of virtual spaces, thus enabling seamless data exchange and interoperability among them. Highlighter demonstrates that nostr events can be leveraged to create, store, and interact with valuable across networks. By utilizing this concept, we can extend the functionality to support federated social media trust, allowing users to carry their reputation, identity, and cryptographic proofs across different virtual spaces and social media platforms.\n\t- Nostr marketplace in LnBits\n\t\t- The nostr markets plugin for LnBits allows virtual ‘stalls’ to be setup and payment to be mediated through nostr. This is obviously a great expansion to the usefulness of our integration\n\t- ## Integrating Cryptographic Proofs and Reputation\n\t\t- To create a trusted environment within the [[federated network]], we must establish a mechanism for importing and verifying [[cryptographic proofs]] from various sources, such as [[social media]] sites and other digital platforms. By doing so, we enable users to bring their existing [[reputation]] and trust from these platforms into the new ecosystem, thus facilitating [[trust-based interactions]] and collaboration within the network. We can leverage the [[Nostr protocol]] and the [[NIP-05]] specification to import these [[cryptographic proofs]], creating a secure and verifiable system for [[identity management]] and [[trust propagation]]. The [[NIP-05]] specification allows for the creation and verification of [[identity proofs]] within the [[Nostr protocol]], thus enabling the seamless integration of trust and [[reputation data]] from external sources.\n\t- By utilizing the Nostr protocol as the underlying layer, we can establish connections between objects, people, and AI actors within the federated network. This interconnected ecosystem allows for seamless collaboration, information sharing, and trust-based interactions among all participants. The open-source collaboration infrastructure we propose can facilitate the development of various applications and services that leverage the federated network, such as virtual workspaces, AI-assisted creativity tools, and more. The uncensorable nature of this protocol further supports the inclusivity and accessibility we feel so important, ensuring that participants from different regions and backgrounds can take part in the digital society and contribute to its growth.\n\t- This federated social media trust model, built on the Nostr protocol, allows for the establishment of a robust, inclusive, and trust-based network that connects various virtual spaces, social media platforms, and AI systems. By leveraging the lessons learned from the other attempts in the space, and by maximising the inclusion of external cryptographic proofs from multiple sources, we can create a comprehensive trust system that fosters collaboration, innovation, and shared growth within the digital society.\n\t- The Nostr protocol, with its decentralized and open-source nature, provides a solid foundation for linking and federating objects, people, and AI actors across collaborative spaces in digital society. By leveraging the Nostr protocol, we can build a robust and trust-based network that interconnects various virtual spaces, social media platforms, and AI systems. One of the key aspects of this trust-based network is the ability to import cryptographic proofs from different sources, similar to Keybase’s approach to importing proofs from various social media sites (Keybase Proofs).\n\t- ## StrFry Relays: High-Performance Infrastructure\n\t\t- The [[StrFry]] relay software provides high-performance infrastructure for building [[decentralized social media]] applications on top of the [[Nostr protocol]]. As an [[open-source]] project written in [[C++]], [[StrFry]] emphasizes efficiency, flexibility, and community-driven governance.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- At the core of [[StrFry]] is its high-speed database engine. Rather than using a traditional [[SQL database]], [[StrFry]] implements the [[Lightning Memory-Mapped Database]] ([[LMDB]])—an embedded [[key-value store]] optimized for performance. Reads are lock-free, enabling unlimited parallel query throughput. Writes require only a short-held lock, ensuring minimal interference. [[LMDB]]'s \"[[shadow paging]]\" design allows isolated read-only transactions via [[multi-version concurrency control]] ([[MVCC]]). This prevents reads from blocking writes and vice versa.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- To maximize database performance, [[StrFry]] stores [[Nostr events]] directly in [[FlatBuffers]]—an efficient [[binary format]] allowing direct access without serialization. The original [[JSON]] payloads are preserved to facilitate transmission back to clients. Additional database files index events on fields like timestamps and authors, accelerating filter queries. Periodic compaction optimizes the layout for faster operations.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- [[StrFry]] adopts a [[multi-threaded]], modular architecture. A [[WebSocket]] thread accepts new client connections and routes incoming requests. An ingester thread validates and pre-processes each request before passing to appropriate handlers. Doing [[signature checks]] and filter compilation upfront avoids repeating work. A single writer thread batches database writes to amortize transaction overhead. Multiple worker threads handle read queries, fairly scheduling between long and short requests. Dedicated monitor threads track active filters and stream matching events to subscribed clients. Passing messages between threads instead of sharing data structures improves efficiency.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- Additional features further enhance [[StrFry]]'s capabilities. Graceful shutdown support allows stopping new connections while existing ones complete. Hot configuration reloading provides runtime updates without restarting. Flexible write policy plugins enable custom [[content moderation]]. Streaming [[WebSocket]] compression and [[Zstandard]] dictionaries compress traffic. Syncing protocols like [[Negentropy]] facilitate efficient [[relay replication]], powering [[mesh network]] topologies. [[Geo-replication]] by the relay.org community offers low latency worldwide access. The custom Templar [[HTML]] templating library assists crafting simple, fast [[decentralized frontends]].\n\t- ## End to end private messages\n\t\t- The current state of direct messages (DMs) on Nostr presents significant privacy concerns. Messages are encrypted using a single public key, exposing metadata and leaving past conversations vulnerable if a private key gets compromised.\n\t\t- To address these issues, a new [DM specification](https://github.com/nostrworld/nostriga/issues/10) (nip104) proposes a double ratchet encryption scheme with ephemeral keys. This approach aims to provide:\n\t\t\t- **Metadata privacy:** Hiding information about who is communicating with whom and how often.\n\t\t\t- **Forward secrecy:** Protecting past messages even if a current private key is compromised.\n\t\t\t- **Post-compromise secrecy:** Ensuring future messages remain secure even if a past private key is compromised.\n\t\t- The new DM spec utilises two key features of Nostr to achieve its privacy goals:\n\t\t\t- **Abundant key space:** Nostr offers an almost infinite number of public-private key pairs, allowing for the generation and disposal of keys without exhaustion.\n\t\t\t- **Decentralized identity:** Nostr's inherent identity system eliminates the need for a central server to verify user identities, a requirement in traditional end-to-end encrypted messaging protocols like Signal.\n\t\t- ### Double Ratchet Encryption and Ephemeral Keys:\n\t\t- The core of the new DM spec lies in the double ratchet algorithm, which employs three chains of keys:\n\t\t\t- **Root chain:** Established through an initial Diffie-Hellman key exchange using the participants' Nostr public keys. This creates a shared secret key that serves as the starting point for the ratchet.\n\t\t\t- **Sending chain:** Used for deriving ephemeral keys for encrypting outgoing messages. Each message uses a new ephemeral key, ensuring forward secrecy.\n\t\t\t- **Receiving chain:** Used for deriving ephemeral keys for decrypting incoming messages. The receiving chain ratchets forward upon receiving a message with a new ephemeral key, guaranteeing post-compromise secrecy.\n\t\t- ### Message Exchange and Session Management:\n\t\t\t- **Session establishment:** When initiating a DM, the sender and receiver perform a Diffie-Hellman key exchange to establish the root chain and initialise their respective ratchet states.\n\t\t\t- **Message encryption:** The sender uses the sending chain to derive a new ephemeral key, encrypts the message, and sends it as a Nostr event.\n\t\t\t- **Message decryption:** The receiver uses the receiving chain to derive the corresponding ephemeral key and decrypt the message. The receiving chain ratchets forward, updating its state for future messages.\n\t\t- ### Challenges and Future Considerations:\n\t\t\t- **Client adoption:** The success of the new DM spec hinges on its implementation across various Nostr clients. Developers need to integrate the necessary cryptographic functions and session management logic.\n\t\t\t- **Device syncing:** Syncing conversations across multiple devices and clients poses a significant challenge due to the lack of a central server. Potential solutions involve broadcasting messages to multiple sessions and managing separate inboxes for each session.\n\t\t\t- **User experience:** The complexity of the double ratchet system and the potential for out-of-order messages may require careful design considerations to ensure a seamless user experience.\n\t- ## Ditto\n\t\t- ### Technical Brief: Ditto and Nostr Integration\n\t\t\t- **Addressing Nostr’s Community Diversity**: One of the primary criticisms of Nostr is that new users predominantly encounter discussions about Bitcoin, which may not appeal to everyone. While Bitcoin is crucial to Nostr’s success, for social media to thrive, it needs diverse communities like those found on mainstream platforms (e.g., Black Twitter, BookTok). Despite Nostr's potential, it is not effectively marketed to these varied communities, which could benefit from integrating with Bitcoin for monetisation.\n\t\t\t- **Past Experience with Spinster and Soapbox**: The success of Spinster, a feminist platform on the Fediverse, demonstrated the viability of niche social media communities. This success led to the development of Soapbox, a configurable platform that allows anyone to create a social media site tailored to specific communities. Soapbox has been used by a wide range of groups, from Christians to furries, and even by Truth Social. The goal is to attract every niche until the platform includes everyone.\n\t\t\t- **Introduction of Ditto**: Ditto is a new Nostr-based community server designed to expand the Nostr network by attracting users through specific communities rather than through Nostr itself. Unlike traditional Nostr apps, where users discover Nostr first, Ditto draws users to communities, with Nostr as a secondary discovery. This approach mirrors the Fediverse's structure, with the advantage that Nostr users are not locked into a single server and can move freely between clients.\n\t\t\t- **Domain and Community Focus**: Ditto servers emphasise independent websites and domain names. Each Ditto server starts with its domain, and users can request a NIP-05 identifier on that domain. The server has a local feed for users, creating a community-specific environment within the broader Nostr network. This model combines the benefits of community-specific engagement with the freedom and decentralisation of Nostr.\n\t\t\t- **Enhancing Community Discovery and Moderation**: Ditto improves user discovery by allowing admins to curate suggested users, helping new users find relevant content and community members. It also features a trending algorithm that tracks popular content, which can be utilised by other Nostr clients to create custom feeds. Each Ditto server has a team of moderators responsible for curating content and maintaining community standards, with users able to move to other servers if they disagree with moderation policies.\n\t\t\t- **Performance and Scalability**: Ditto has been optimised for performance, with detailed monitoring tools to track server activity and troubleshoot issues. This performance focus is crucial for supporting thousands of users and ensuring a smooth experience on the platform.\n\t\t\t- **Bitcoin Integration and Zaps**: Ditto integrates with Bitcoin to support lightning zaps, enhancing monetisation opportunities within communities. Zap splits are being developed to provide financial sustainability for server operators, ensuring that community servers remain viable over the long term.\n\t\t\t- **Technology Stack**: Ditto is built as a TypeScript server running in Deno, with a PostgreSQL database. It functions as both a NIP-01 client and a relay, making it a full-fledged Nostr server. The server's design leverages NIP-46 for secure event signing, enabling compatibility with existing Mastodon apps while maintaining the decentralised ethos of Nostr.\n\t\t\t- **Expanding Nostr’s Reach**: The goal of Ditto is to make Nostr more accessible and appealing by leveraging existing social media app ecosystems like Mastodon. Users can use their favourite Mastodon apps on Ditto, providing a familiar experience while accessing Nostr’s decentralised network.\n\t\t\t- **Future Developments**: Upcoming features include zap splits to enhance server sustainability and a creator programme to support those who wish to start Ditto servers. A mentorship programme has also been launched to help new developers contribute to Nostr and Bitcoin projects.\n\t\t-\n- {{renderer :linkpreview,https://nate.mecca1.net/posts/2024-01-30_microblogging-protocols/}}\n- [Post Details | Ditto](https://ditto.pub/@hzrd149.com/posts/1299e04c56891c12a800e234ee7ee02067152e2cf29f9e17b7b4f979f5f8c075) [[Nostr protocol]]\n\t- [noStrudel hosted on nostr + blossom servers and served over tor ...](https://nostr.at/nevent1qqsp9x0qf3tgj8qj4qqwyd8w0mszqec49ck098u7z7mmf7te7huvqagpp4mhxue69uhkummn9ekx7mqpz3mhxue69uhhyetvv9ujuerpd46hxtnfduq3zamnwvaz7tmwdaehgun4v5hxxmmdqgszv6q4uryjzr06xfxxew34wwc5hmjfmfpqn229d72gfegsdn2q3fgxvc346)\n- [Get A Nostr Signing Device To Keep Your Nostr Identity Secure!](https://nostrsigningdevice.com/)\n- [Python nostr client](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw5SZyYBuPk&t=1471s)\n- [Python nostr repo, months old](https://github.com/jeffthibault/python-nostr)\n- [nostrpy](https://github.com/monty888/nostrpy)\n- [lnbits enable extensions mode for nostr](https://github.com/raspiblitz/raspiblitz/issues/3799)\n- [tailscale forum posts](https://community.umbrel.com/t/introducing-the-official-nostr-relay-app/11339/17)\n- [Relay list](https://nostr.info/relays/)\n- [WSS check](https://websocketking.com/)\n- [nostr market guide](https://darthcoin.substack.com/p/lnbits-nostr-market)\n- [Nostr coinjoin github](https://gitlab.com/1440000bytes/joinstr)\n- [nostr blinded assets](https://thebitcoinmanual.com/articles/blinded-nostr-assets/)\n- [NIP-112 encrypted private chats](https://github.com/ArcadeLabsInc/arcade/wiki/NIP-112:-Encrypted-Group-Chat)\n- Nostr Data Layer\n\t- [NIP90\n\t\t- NIP-90\n\t\t- Data Vending Machine (nostr.com)](https://nips.nostr.com/90)\n\t- [Nooooooooogle (noogle.lol)](https://noogle.lol/)\n\t- [DVM data inferencing](https://github.com/pablof7z/nostr-data-vending-machine)\n\t- [NIP 90 data markets](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/682)\n\t- [DVM data inferencing](https://github.com/pablof7z/nostr-data-vending-machine)\n- [noskey, convert between things](https://github.com/melvincarvalho/noskey)\n- [nostr smart contracts stuff (melvin)](https://dev.to/melvincarvalho/smart-events-contracts-over-nostr-a-consensus-based-approach-1l9n)\n- [3d space thing](https://github.com/bongatores/nostrSpace)\n- Key generation and management\n- [BIP85 master key javascript](https://github.com/AndreasGassmann/bip85#readme)\n- [supertestnet/nostr-image-host: Upload and view images on the web without an api key (github.com)](https://github.com/supertestnet/nostr-image-host)\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
