  "content": "- ### OntologyBlock\n  id:: presence-ontology\n  collapsed:: true\n\t- ontology:: true\n\t- term-id:: 20256\n\t- source-domain:: metaverse\n\t- status:: draft\n\t- public-access:: true\n\n\n## Academic Context\n\n- Presence is understood as the **psychological experience of “being there”** within a virtual or mixed environment, distinct from mere technological immersion.\n  - Early VR research often conflated presence with technological sophistication, but contemporary studies emphasise its psychological and social dimensions, including narrative content, user characteristics, and socio-cultural context[1].\n  - Foundational work distinguishes presence from immersion: immersion relates to sensory input and system capabilities, whereas presence involves cognitive and emotional engagement with the virtual environment[2][5].\n  - The concept includes multiple dimensions such as spatial presence (feeling located in the environment), social presence (feeling connected to others), and self-presence (sense of embodiment or agency within the virtual space)[3].\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Presence is a critical metric in VR and mixed reality (MR) applications across education, healthcare, entertainment, and remote collaboration.\n  - Industry adoption has expanded with platforms integrating advanced head-mounted displays (HMDs) featuring high-resolution OLED panels, precise head and body tracking, and spatial audio to enhance presence[4].\n  - Notable organisations include Meta, Microsoft, and emerging UK-based companies innovating in spatial computing and immersive experiences.\n  - In the UK, especially in North England, cities like Manchester and Leeds host VR innovation hubs focusing on immersive training, cultural heritage, and healthcare applications.\n- Technical capabilities now support real-time interaction with virtual environments through sophisticated tracking and mapping systems, enabling naturalistic user movements to be mirrored virtually, which enhances presence[2][4].\n- Limitations remain in achieving consistent presence across diverse users due to individual differences in cognitive processing and psychological factors[3].\n- Standards and frameworks are evolving to incorporate psychological measures of presence alongside technical benchmarks, with validated questionnaires assessing place illusion, plausibility, and social presence[3].\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic contributions:\n  - Bown, White, and Boopalan (2017) on early VR development and presence foundations.\n  - Della Libera et al. (2023) developed a validated Presence Questionnaire measuring multiple presence dimensions with strong psychometric properties[3].\n  - Recent synthesis by Nature Communications (2025) emphasises presence as a multi-dimensional psychological phenomenon shaped by content, user traits, and socio-cultural context[1].\n  - Steuer (1992) introduced the concept of \"mapping\" linking real-world actions to virtual responses, foundational for understanding presence mechanisms[2].\n- Ongoing research explores:\n  - The interplay between desire for control and presence under varying immersive conditions[3].\n  - Cognitive mediation processes influencing presence beyond sensory immersion[2].\n  - Refining presence measurement tools to better capture subjective experience and its variability across populations.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK contributes significantly to presence research and VR development, with universities such as the University of Manchester and Newcastle University leading studies on immersive technologies and user experience.\n- North England innovation hubs in Manchester, Leeds, and Sheffield focus on applying presence-enhancing VR in sectors like healthcare training, cultural heritage preservation, and remote collaboration.\n- Regional case studies include VR projects for NHS training simulations in Leeds and cultural VR experiences developed in Manchester museums, leveraging presence to improve engagement and learning outcomes.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends:\n  - Integration of spatial computing paradigms that seamlessly merge physical and virtual realities, enhancing presence through naturalistic interaction and contextual awareness[6].\n  - Advances in AI-driven adaptive content to personalise presence experiences based on user traits and preferences.\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Addressing individual variability in presence experience to ensure equitable and effective VR applications.\n  - Balancing technological sophistication with psychological and social factors to avoid presence illusions that may cause disorientation or discomfort.\n- Research priorities:\n  - Developing standardised, multi-dimensional presence metrics for cross-study comparability.\n  - Investigating long-term effects of presence on cognition, behaviour, and wellbeing.\n  - Exploring presence in shared virtual environments to enhance social and collaborative experiences.\n\n## References\n\n1.
