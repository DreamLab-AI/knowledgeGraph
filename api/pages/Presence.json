(2023) developed a validated Presence Questionnaire measuring multiple presence dimensions with strong psychometric properties[3].\n  - Recent synthesis by Nature Communications (2025) emphasises presence as a multi-dimensional psychological phenomenon shaped by content, user traits, and socio-cultural context[1].\n  - Steuer (1992) introduced the concept of \"mapping\" linking real-world actions to virtual responses, foundational for understanding presence mechanisms[2].\n- Ongoing research explores:\n  - The interplay between desire for control and presence under varying immersive conditions[3].\n  - Cognitive mediation processes influencing presence beyond sensory immersion[2].\n  - Refining presence measurement tools to better capture subjective experience and its variability across populations.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK contributes significantly to presence research and VR development, with universities such as the University of Manchester and Newcastle University leading studies on immersive technologies and user experience.\n- North England innovation hubs in Manchester, Leeds, and Sheffield focus on applying presence-enhancing VR in sectors like healthcare training, cultural heritage preservation, and remote collaboration.\n- Regional case studies include VR projects for NHS training simulations in Leeds and cultural VR experiences developed in Manchester museums, leveraging presence to improve engagement and learning outcomes.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends:\n  - Integration of spatial computing paradigms that seamlessly merge physical and virtual realities, enhancing presence through naturalistic interaction and contextual awareness[6].\n  - Advances in AI-driven adaptive content to personalise presence experiences based on user traits and preferences.\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Addressing individual variability in presence experience to ensure equitable and effective VR applications.\n  - Balancing technological sophistication with psychological and social factors to avoid presence illusions that may cause disorientation or discomfort.\n- Research priorities:\n  - Developing standardised, multi-dimensional presence metrics for cross-study comparability.\n  - Investigating long-term effects of presence on cognition, behaviour, and wellbeing.\n  - Exploring presence in shared virtual environments to enhance social and collaborative experiences.\n\n## References\n\n1.
