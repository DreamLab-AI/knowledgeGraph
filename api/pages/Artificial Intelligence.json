An engineered system that generates outputs such as content, forecasts, recommendations, or decisions for a given set of human-defined objectives. AI systems use machine and human-based inputs to perceive real and virtual environments, abstract such perceptions into models through analysis in an automated manner, and use model inference to formulate options for information or action.\n\n**Source**: ISO/IEC 22989:2022, Clauses 3.1.1-3.1.2 - Authority Score: 0.95\n\n### Alternative Definitions\n1. **NIST AI RMF 1.0**: Research and development of mechanisms and applications of systems that perceive, reason, learn, and act. A discipline encompassing computer science, cognitive science, mathematics, and engineering focused on creating intelligent machines. - Authority Score: 0.92\n2. **EU AI Act (Article 3)**: The capability of systems to perform human-like tasks involving perception, reasoning, learning, decision-making, and problem-solving. - Authority Score: 0.90\n\n### Operational Characteristics\n- **Perception**: Ability to interpret sensory or virtual environment data through sensors, cameras, microphones, or data feeds\n- **Abstraction**: Process of creating models, patterns, or representations from raw input data\n- **Inference**: Use of models to generate predictions, recommendations, or decisions\n- **Learning**: Capability to improve performance through experience with data\n- **Autonomy**: Degree of independence from human intervention in operation\n\n\n# Artificial Intelligence Ontology Entry – Updated 2025\n\n## Academic Context\n\n- Artificial intelligence represents the simulation of human cognitive functions in computational systems\n  - Encompasses machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing as primary subfields\n  - Emerged as a formal discipline over 70 years ago, with contemporary focus on generative AI capabilities\n  - Defined by NASA and the US National Defense Authorization Act as systems performing tasks under varying circumstances without significant human oversight, or capable of learning from experience\n  - Increasingly recognised as foundational technology comparable to electricity or the internet in transformative potential\n\n- Core capabilities and scope\n  - Perception, reasoning, learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and creative generation\n  - Ability to process vast datasets and identify complex patterns autonomously\n  - Performance improvement through exposure to data without explicit reprogramming\n  - Simulation of human-like cognition through neural networks and algorithmic systems\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Generative AI dominates contemporary research and commercial development, enabling creation of original text, images, video, and multimedia content\n  - Machine learning remains the most prevalent operational form of AI across industries\n  - Applications span virtual assistants, image recognition, autonomous vehicles, medical diagnostics, and real-time customer support systems\n  - Concentration of cutting-edge model development among select large technology companies due to substantial hardware costs and data requirements\n  - 2024 Nobel Prizes awarded for physics and chemistry work intimately related to AI applications\n\n- Technical capabilities and current limitations\n  - Models may generate inaccurate or biased outcomes, particularly with insufficient high-quality training data\n  - Data quality and quantity remain critical determinants of system performance\n  - Computational requirements for training leading models remain prohibitively expensive for most organisations\n  - Three primary machine learning categories: supervised learning (pattern recognition from labelled data), unsupervised learning (pattern discovery from unlabelled data), and reinforcement learning (reward optimisation through environmental interaction)\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - UK institutions increasingly prominent in AI research and development, though hardware infrastructure concentration remains limited\n  - Manchester, Leeds, and Newcastle emerging as regional technology hubs with growing AI research capacity\n  - British academic institutions contributing to foundational AI research, though resource constraints limit large-scale model development compared to US counterparts\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Foundational definitions and frameworks\n  - NASA (2024). *What is Artificial Intelligence?* Executive Order 13960 definition framework, incorporating Section 238(g) of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2019\n  - Stanford Emerging Technology Review (2025). *Artificial Intelligence*. Comprehensive overview of computer vision, machine learning, and natural language processing subfields\n  - IBM (2024). *What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?* Nested conceptual framework spanning 70+ years of disciplinary development\n\n- Technical subfields and methodologies\n  - Deep learning: multilayered neural networks enabling autonomous feature extraction from complex datasets\n  - Natural language processing: computational systems for understanding, interpreting, and generating human language\n  - Computer vision: machine recognition and interpretation of visual information with decision-making capabilities\n  - Decision support systems: tools for evaluating multiple outcomes and probabilities under conditions of imperfect or unknown information\n\n- Contemporary research directions\n  - Generative AI capabilities and limitations\n  - Data quality and bias mitigation in model training\n  - Computational efficiency and accessibility of model development\n  - Integration of AI into sustainable design and resource optimisation\n\n## UK Context\n\n- British research contributions\n  - UK universities conducting significant foundational research in machine learning and neural network architectures\n  - Growing emphasis on responsible AI development and ethical frameworks within British academic institutions\n  - Limited but expanding commercial AI development sector outside London's established tech corridor\n\n- North England innovation landscape\n  - Manchester: emerging AI research clusters within university computer science departments and technology startups\n  - Leeds: growing digital innovation sector with increasing AI applications in healthcare and manufacturing\n  - Newcastle: developing technology hub with research focus on applied AI systems\n  - Regional challenge: concentration of venture capital and hardware infrastructure remains heavily weighted toward London and South East\n\n- Practical applications in UK context\n  - NHS utilising AI for diagnostic support and resource optimisation\n  - Financial services sector (particularly in Manchester and Leeds) adopting machine learning for risk assessment and fraud detection\n  - Manufacturing sector exploring AI-driven process optimisation, particularly relevant to North England's industrial heritage\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging technical developments\n  - Advancement toward more efficient, smaller-scale models reducing computational barriers to entry\n  - Enhanced interpretability and explainability of AI decision-making processes\n  - Integration of multimodal AI systems combining text, image, video, and sensor data\n  - Potential progression toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), though timeline and feasibility remain contested\n\n- Anticipated challenges\n  - Bias and accuracy concerns in models trained on insufficient or unrepresentative data\n  - Concentration of AI development capability among limited number of well-resourced organisations\n  - Regulatory frameworks and governance structures still developing across jurisdictions\n  - Skills gap in AI literacy and technical expertise across sectors and regions\n\n- Research priorities\n  - Data quality standards and curation methodologies\n  - Computational efficiency and democratisation of model development\n  - Ethical frameworks and responsible AI deployment\n  - Regional capacity building, particularly in underrepresented areas such as North England\n  - Integration of AI with circular economy and sustainable design principles\n\n---\n\n**Technical note:** This entry reflects the state of AI development as of November 2025. The field evolves rapidly; readers should consult current academic journals and institutional repositories for developments beyond this date. The concentration of AI capability remains a significant structural feature of the contemporary landscape—rather like observing that most of the electricity generation capacity remains in the hands of a few large utilities, albeit with increasingly distributed alternatives emerging.\n\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-11\n- **Review Status**: Comprehensive editorial review\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
