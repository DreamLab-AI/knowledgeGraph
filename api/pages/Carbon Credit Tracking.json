Morgan) has developed a blockchain application for tokenising carbon market registries, with testing underway by S&P Global, EcoRegistry, and the International Carbon Registry\n\t- Nasdaq has invested in blockchain solutions to digitise carbon credit registries and streamline pre-issuance processes\n\t- Carbonmark automates purchase and retirement flows, integrates with fintech applications, and supports fractionalised credits\n- UK and North England examples where relevant\n\t- UK-based fintechs and environmental consultancies are increasingly adopting blockchain for carbon credit tracking, particularly in Manchester, Leeds, and Newcastle\n\t- The Northern Powerhouse initiative has supported several pilot projects exploring blockchain for environmental asset management, including carbon credits\n\t- Local authorities in Sheffield have partnered with tech firms to pilot blockchain-based tracking for municipal carbon offsetting schemes\n- Technical capabilities and limitations\n\t- Blockchain provides a tamper-proof ledger for the entire lifecycle of carbon credits, from issuance to retirement\n\t- Integration with IoT sensors, satellites, and AI enables real-time monitoring and automated verification\n\t- Limitations include upfront development costs, transaction fees, and the need for standardisation across platforms\n- Standards and frameworks\n\t- Regulatory bodies are developing standardised smart contract frameworks to harmonise cross-border carbon trading protocols\n\t- The International Carbon Registry and other major registries are adopting blockchain standards to ensure uniformity and trust\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers and sources\n\t- Sugumaran, D., Dhanapal, J., & Johnson, R.
