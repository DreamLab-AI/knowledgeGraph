(2025). *Human-AI Interaction Design Standards*. Handbook of Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence. This work summarises international standards and design principles for effective human-AI interaction, highlighting ethical and usability considerations[6].\n  - ETSI Technical Specifications and Group Reports (2025) on AI agents, network slicing, and securing AI provide foundational frameworks for integrating AI with human interfaces in complex systems[1][2][4].\n- Ongoing research focuses on improving AI explainability, adaptive user experience, multi-agent collaboration, and the integration of AI with emerging 6G networks.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK contributes significantly through both academic research and industrial innovation in AI-human interface technologies.\n  - Centres such as the University of Manchester’s Human Factors Research Group and the Digital Institute at Leeds lead in gesture recognition and emotion detection research.\n  - Newcastle and Sheffield host innovation hubs fostering AI applications in healthcare and smart city interfaces, often supported by UK government funding and industry partnerships.\n- Regional case studies demonstrate successful deployment of conversational AI in customer service and intelligent user adaptation in public transport systems, reflecting the practical benefits of these technologies.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include:\n  - Integration of large language models (LLMs) as natural language interfaces within AI-human systems.\n  - Enhanced multi-modal sensing combining biometric, behavioural, and contextual data for richer interaction.\n  - Greater emphasis on ethical AI, privacy preservation, and regulatory compliance, particularly under evolving UK and EU frameworks.\n- Anticipated challenges involve balancing user autonomy with AI assistance, mitigating bias in emotion and gesture recognition, and ensuring accessibility across diverse populations.\n- Research priorities include developing standardised evaluation metrics for AI-human interface effectiveness and advancing adaptive systems that learn continuously from user feedback.\n\n## References\n\n1.
