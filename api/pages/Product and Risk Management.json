This likely does have impact on your business goals.\n\t\t\t- #### Mitigate GenAI risks through product management. Maybe don't just be grabby for AI.\n\t\t- **Question 1: Where Do We Want to Go?**\n\t\t\t- **Vision and Goal Setting**: Defining a clear destination or North Star.\n\t\t\t\t- My northstar (as an example) is\n\t\t\t\t- ```Equity of opportunity of access to AI, to support a fairer world. ```\n\t\t\t- **Where Are We Coming From?\n\t\t- Product market analysis** :  In your business this is more likely to be a function of your product methodolgy\n\t\t\t- I am coming from a position of understanding collaboration in groups, across technology, \n\t\t\t  **where some members of the group are likely to be AI.**\n\t\t\t- **Where Should We Go Next?**\n\t\t- **Strategic Planning**: Deciding the next steps based on vision and current status.\n\t\t\t- For me, this mean helping build B2B capabilities,\n\t\t\t- Education, and interweaving of people and AI through storytelling,\n\t\t\t- Distributed, global, AI enabled infrastructure,\n\t\t\t- Clearly communicating why,\n\t\t\t- Building communities to help.\n\t- This won't be you and your company, but this is a great time to work out these checklists.\n\t\t- **SWOT Analysis**: Evaluating strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.\n\t\t- I am trying to build **this** bit of the business journey through these presentations\n\t\t- ![GCh-erEbgAAZS3c](../assets/GCh-erEbgAAZS3c.jpeg){:height 700, :width 400}\n- # Everyone's pivoting to generative AI.\n\t- {{twitter https://twitter.com/petergyang/status/1667539634577092609}}\n\t\t- [Link to Tweet](https://twitter.com/petergyang/status/1667539634577092609)\n\t\t- But my alarm bells go off when I see:\n\t\t\t- ? A crowded landscape\n\t\t\t- ? FOMO driven decision making\n\t\t\t- ? Sky high valuations for an early space\n\t\t- If you took the word \"AI\" out, is the product still solving a customer problem?\n\t\t- AI is a solution, not a problem. Ask yourself:\n\t\t\t- What is the pain point?\n\t\t\t- How many users share this pain?\n\t\t\t- Is the pain big enough to take action?\n\t\t\t- Is the pain underserved by non-AI tools?\n\t\t\t- How accurate does the solution need to be?\n\t\t- Plot the problem on a fluency vs. accuracy grid.\n\t\t\t- Gen AI today is great for high fluency + low accuracy problems (e.g., productivity).\n\t\t\t- It's not great for solutions that need high accuracy (e.g., financial decisions).\n\t\t- How fast will incumbents move?\n\t\t\t- Incumbents like Microsoft, Google, and Adobe have moved incredibly fast on AI.\n\t\t\t- Startups that overlap with core incumbent use cases might struggle.\n\t\t- AI presentation startups need to be MUCH better than AI in Powerpoint to thrive.\n\t\t\t- Is there a moat? Examples moats include:\n\t\t- Access to proprietary data and models\n\t\t\t- Exclusive contracts with large customers\n\t\t\t- Great product even without AI\n\t\t\t- Exceptional talent in the selected field\n\t\t\t- Business models that incumbents avoid\n\t\t\t- And of course...speed of execution.\n\t\t- Is it overvalued?\n\t\t\t- If an AI product already has $100M+ valuation, you should think:\n\t\t\t- Can it continue to grow and (more importantly) retain users?\n\t\t\t- In a crowded space like AI copywriting and productivity\n\t\t- that could get hard.\n\t\t- To recap, here are 5 questions to ask to evaluate AI products and companies:\n\t\t\t- 1. Without \"AI\", is it still solving a problem?\n\t\t\t  2. How accurate does the solution need to be?\n\t\t\t  3. How fast will incumbents move?\n\t\t\t  4. Is there a moat?\n\t\t\t  5. Is it overvalued?\n\t\t\t  7/ I hope these questions also help builders who are thinking of creating new AI products.\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
