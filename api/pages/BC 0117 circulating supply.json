[Updated 2025]\n\t\t- This metric excludes:\n\t\t\t- [[Locked tokens]] held in smart contracts or escrow\n\t\t\t- [[Reserved tokens]] allocated for team, advisors, or foundation\n\t\t\t- [[Burned tokens]] permanently removed from circulation\n\t\t\t- Tokens subject to [[vesting schedules]] or time-locks\n\t\t\t- Tokens held in treasury or strategic reserves\n\t\t- Circulating supply is fundamental for calculating [[market capitalization]] (circulating supply × current price) and assessing [[token liquidity]].\n\n\t- ### Technical Definition\n\t\t- A formally-defined economic metric in [[blockchain]] systems that quantifies the [[liquid supply]] of digital assets available for trading, transfers, and economic activity at a specific point in time.\n\t\t- Circulating supply is determined through [[on-chain analysis]], smart contract queries, and transparent reporting by token issuers.\n\t\t- Accurate circulating supply data requires:\n\t\t\t- Real-time blockchain state analysis\n\t\t\t- Smart contract audit of locked/vesting tokens\n\t\t\t- Transparent disclosure from project teams\n\t\t\t- Standardized calculation methodologies\n\n\t- ### Standards-Based Definition\n\t\t- According to **ISO/IEC 23257:2021** (Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies — Reference architecture), circulating supply represents a fundamental economic parameter of tokenized systems that must be transparently calculated and reported for market integrity. This international standard provides guidelines for blockchain reference architecture, including token lifecycle management, supply mechanics, and economic parameter disclosure. It emphasizes the importance of accurately distinguishing between total supply, maximum supply, and circulating supply to prevent market manipulation and ensure investor protection. [Updated 2025] [Source: ISO/IEC 23257:2021]\n\t\t- **NIST NISTIR 8202** (Blockchain Technology Overview) addresses token supply metrics as critical components of blockchain transparency and accountability. This technical report from the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology provides comprehensive guidance on blockchain technology fundamentals, including tokenomics, supply chain integrity, and circulating supply verification methods. NIST emphasizes that circulating supply calculations must account for locked tokens, staking mechanisms, and programmatic release schedules to provide accurate market data.

[Updated 2025]\n\t\t\t- **UK Financial Sanctions** considerations: HM Treasury's Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation provides guidance on UK financial sanctions FAQs (available at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-financial-sanctions-faqs/uk-financial-sanctions-faqs), which addresses cryptocurrency compliance requirements. While primarily focused on sanctions enforcement, these guidelines have implications for circulating supply reporting, particularly regarding sanctioned addresses and frozen tokens that must be excluded from circulating supply calculations. UK-based crypto projects must ensure their circulating supply figures exclude tokens held in wallets subject to UK sanctions.

The authors demonstrate that sudden increases in circulating supply (from token unlocks or vesting events) correlate with significant negative price impacts, with an average -12.4% price decline within 30 days of major unlock events. The paper introduces econometric models for predicting price formation based on supply-side shocks and demand elasticity in cryptocurrency markets.
