Scenism places a strong emphasis on the power of creating immersive and visually captivating experiences for its audience. It aims to go beyond merely presenting a piece of art or storytelling, and instead seeks to transport the audience into a vivid and engaging world. At the core of the Scenism manifesto is the belief that the environment or setting plays a crucial role in shaping the overall experience. Scenists believe that by creating intricate and detailed environments, they can enhance the emotional impact of the art form. This goes beyond simply designing a visually pleasing backdrop; it involves creating a multi-sensory experience that allows the audience to feel fully immersed in the world being presented.\n\t\t- Scenists also recognize the importance of collaboration and interdisciplinary approaches in creating truly impactful experiences. They advocate for the involvement of professionals from various fields such as set design, lighting design, sound design, costume design, and more, to work together seamlessly and cohesively. This collaborative effort ensures that every aspect of the scenography supports and enhances the overall experience.\n\t\t- Another key aspect of Scenism is the utilization of technology and innovation. Scenists embrace advancements in technology to push the boundaries of what can be achieved in terms of creating immersive experiences. This includes the use of virtual reality, augmented reality, interactive elements, and other cutting-edge tools to enhance the audience's engagement and deepen their connection with the artistic work.\n\t\t- Scenism also seeks to challenge traditional audience-performer dynamics. Instead of passive viewers, the manifesto encourages the audience to actively engage with the environment and participate in the experience. This can involve interactive elements, audience interaction, or even blurring the lines between the performer and the spectator. The goal is to create an inclusive and participatory atmosphere where the audience becomes an integral part of the artistic narrative.\n\t\t- In summary, the Scenism manifesto underscores the importance of creating immersive, visually captivating experiences that go beyond traditional art forms. By emphasizing the role of intricate environments, collaboration, technology, and active audience engagement, Scenism aims to push boundaries and unlock new realms of artistic expression and engagement.\n\t\t- a further exploration of my Scenism manifesto, and is a practice based art research project.\n- # Papers Planning\n- This is a portfolio of papers describing the history of these moments, artists, and technologies\n  id:: 65cbd02d-8454-417f-ba42-34c70f1c02d3\n\t- {{embed ((65e04fa2-0e47-4829-8e09-5ccf65118a54))}}\n\t- # Gamescapes\n\t\t- Holding text\n\t- # The Binding Paper\n\t\t- **If the generations of A.I to follow dream of the first virtual places, will they dream of Turner, Constable and Monet?
