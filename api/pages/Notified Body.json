Brussels: EC Publications.\n- Ongoing research focuses on improving conformity assessment methodologies for adaptive AI systems, enhancing transparency metrics, and integrating cybersecurity assessments into conformity frameworks.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- Post-Brexit, the UK has established its own regulatory pathways for AI conformity assessment but maintains close alignment with EU frameworks to facilitate trade and interoperability.\n- British conformity assessment bodies, particularly in the North of England, are increasingly active in AI system evaluation, leveraging regional strengths in AI research and industry.\n- Innovation hubs in Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield contribute to AI safety research, regulatory consultancy, and testing services, often collaborating with UK government initiatives and industry partners.\n- Regional case studies include partnerships between universities and local businesses to pilot conformity assessment processes for AI in healthcare diagnostics and smart city applications.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include the integration of AI lifecycle monitoring into conformity assessments, addressing AI system adaptiveness post-deployment.\n- Anticipated challenges involve keeping pace with rapid AI innovation, ensuring global regulatory harmonisation, and managing the balance between innovation and risk mitigation.\n- Research priorities focus on developing standardised metrics for AI transparency, robustness, and fairness, as well as enhancing the cybersecurity posture of AI systems under assessment.\n- The role of Notified Bodies may expand to include advisory functions and support for AI literacy initiatives, reflecting the AI Act’s broader governance objectives.\n\n## References\n\n1.
