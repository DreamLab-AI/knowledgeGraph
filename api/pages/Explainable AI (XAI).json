Information Fusion, 58, 82-115. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.inffus.2019.12.012\n- Ongoing research directions focus on:\n  - Enhancing explanation fidelity without sacrificing model performance.\n  - Developing standardised metrics for explanation quality.\n  - Integrating causal reasoning and symbolic AI for richer, more human-aligned explanations.\n  - Addressing ethical challenges such as bias detection and mitigation through explainability.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK has been a significant contributor to XAI research and deployment, with government initiatives supporting responsible AI development.\n- North England hosts several innovation hubs advancing XAI:\n  - Manchester’s AI and Data Science Institute conducts cutting-edge research on interpretable machine learning.\n  - Leeds and Sheffield universities collaborate on ethical AI frameworks emphasising transparency and fairness.\n  - Newcastle’s Centre for Digital Intelligence explores explainability in AI applications for healthcare and public services.\n- Regional case studies include NHS trusts in North England adopting XAI tools to improve transparency in clinical decision support systems, enhancing patient trust and regulatory compliance.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include:\n  - Greater integration of neuro-symbolic AI and causal discovery methods to produce explanations that are both accurate and intuitively understandable.\n  - Expansion of federated explainability techniques to enable privacy-preserving transparency in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance.\n  - Development of standardised, interoperable XAI frameworks to facilitate regulatory compliance and cross-industry adoption.\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Balancing explanation complexity with user cognitive load to avoid overwhelming non-expert users.\n  - Ensuring explanations do not become mere \"window dressing\" but genuinely improve trust and accountability.\n  - Addressing the ethical implications of explainability in AI systems that may still harbour hidden biases or errors.\n- Research priorities include refining explanation evaluation metrics, improving human-AI interaction models, and embedding explainability into AI lifecycle management.\n\n## References\n\n1.
