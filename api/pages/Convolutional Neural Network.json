The architecture employs convolutional layers containing learnable kernels (typically 3x3 or 5x5 matrices) that slide across input feature maps via discrete convolution operations, detecting local patterns such as edges, textures, and object parts in early layers and progressively more abstract, semantic features in deeper layers. Core architectural components include convolutional layers (feature extraction via learned filters with shared weights), pooling layers (spatial downsampling via max or average operations reducing dimensionality while maintaining dominant features), normalization layers (batch normalization or layer normalization for training stability), activation functions (ReLU, GELU providing non-linearity), and fully connected layers (final classification or regression). Modern variants incorporate skip connections (ResNet), dense connections (DenseNet), depthwise separable convolutions (MobileNet, EfficientNet), attention mechanisms (Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks), and neural architecture search optimizations. CNNs leverage three key principles: local connectivity (each neuron connects only to a local region of the input), parameter sharing (same filter weights applied across spatial locations), and equivariance to translation (shifted inputs produce correspondingly shifted feature maps). While transformers have challenged CNN dominance in some vision tasks, CNNs remain highly effective for problems with strong spatial inductive biases, computational efficiency requirements, and limited training data, formalized in implementations across TensorFlow, PyTorch, and ONNX Runtime following architectural patterns established by LeCun et al. (LeNet, 1998), Krizhevsky et al. (AlexNet, 2012), and He et al.
