In 2025, money has evolved from physical commodities (shells, gold) through government-issued fiat currency to digital forms including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and Central Bank Digital Currencies.\n\n  - In the context of blockchain and disruptive technologies, money encompasses traditional fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies like [[Bitcoin]], central bank digital currencies ([[CBDC]]), stablecoins such as [[USDC]] and [[USDT]], and virtual currencies in metaverse environments, reflecting the convergence of physical, digital, and virtual economic systems.\n\n  - ### Three Functions of Money\n    id:: money-functions\n\n    #### 1. Medium of Exchange\n    - **Purpose**: Facilitates trade by eliminating the need for double coincidence of wants in barter\n    - **Digital Evolution**: Instant payments, [[programmable money]], atomic swaps via [[smart contracts]]\n    - **2025 Status**: Cryptocurrency transactions reach $600B in cross-border payments (Q2 2024 baseline), Bitcoin commands 42% of merchant crypto transactions\n    - **Examples**: Cash payments, bank transfers, [[Lightning Network]] payments, [[USDC]] transfers via Stripe\n\n    #### 2. Unit of Account\n    - **Purpose**: Common measure for pricing goods, services, and assets\n    - **Requirements**: Standardization, stability, transparency\n    - **2025 Challenge**: Exchange rate volatility remains a factor, but major stablecoins reduce this\n    - **Examples**: USD pricing, [[BTC/USD]] pair trading, [[USDC]] denominated contracts\n\n    #### 3. Store of Value\n    - **Purpose**: Preserve purchasing power across time\n    - **2025 Developments**: [[Bitcoin]] strengthens narrative as \"digital gold,\" stablecoins provide alternative store of value\n    - **Examples**: Savings accounts, gold, Bitcoin holdings, USDC reserves\n\n  - ### Forms of Money [Updated 2025]\n    id:: money-forms\n\n    #### Fiat Currency\n    - **Definition**: Government-issued money not backed by physical commodity\n    - **2025 Context**: Facing evolution with [[CBDC]] emergence, but remains primary medium globally\n    - **Examples**: US Dollar ([[USD]]), Euro ([[EUR]]), Japanese Yen ([[JPY]])\n    - **Regulatory Framework**: ISO 4217 standards maintained\n\n    #### Cryptocurrency\n    - **Definition**: Decentralized digital currency using cryptography and blockchain technology\n    - **Key Variants**: [[Bitcoin]] (store of value), [[Ethereum]] (smart contract platform), [[Litecoin]]\n    - **2025 Market Status**: Crypto transactions exceed $600B annually in cross-border payments; merchant adoption growing 82.1% (2024-2026 projection)\n    - **Regulatory Challenge**: Varied global approaches, but clearing trend toward framework establishment\n\n    #### Stablecoin [Updated 2025]\n    - **Definition**: Cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets (typically 1:1 USD backing)\n    - **Major Players**: [[USDC]] (33.8% growth to $39.7B TVL in 2025), [[USDT]] (reduced to $74.4B amid regulatory pressure)\n    - **2025 Regulatory Framework**:\n      - **USA**: [[GENIUS Act]] (signed July 2025) establishes federal framework requiring 100% reserve backing and monthly reporting\n      - **EU**: MiCA compliance driving USDT delistings, promoting USDC adoption\n    - **Use Cases**: Cross-border remittances, DeFi composability, payment settlements\n    - **Advantages**: Reduced volatility vs cryptocurrencies, faster than traditional transfers\n\n    #### Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) [Comprehensive 2025 Update]\n    - **Definition**: Digital form of fiat currency issued directly by central bank\n    - **Status**: 91% of 93 central banks exploring CBDC (BIS survey 2024); 137 countries (98% global GDP) investigating\n\n    - **Leading Implementations 2025**:\n      - **China Digital Yuan (e-CNY)**: Most advanced retail CBDC—₹7 trillion cumulative transaction volume (June 2024), 120 million wallets active, available in multiple provinces. Adoption challenged by preference for AliPay/WeChat Pay (represents 0.16% of M0 supply)\n      - **India e-Rupee**: Second-largest pilot—₹10.16 billion in circulation (March 2025), up 334% YoY from ₹2.34 billion. RBI expanding to include offline payments for rural areas with limited connectivity\n      - **Bahamas Sand Dollar**: First fully deployed retail CBDC (launched 2020), providing real-world lessons for other jurisdictions\n      - **Sweden e-Krona**: Testing for cashless society transition\n      - **Russia Digital Ruble**: Pilot testing completed 2023-2024; gradual adoption expected 2025\n      - **Europe**: ECB investigating digital euro, decision timeline delayed; UK exploring digital pound (pilot expected 2025+); Germany and Mexico in development phase\n\n    - **Global Landscape**: G20 nations show phased approach—12 countries (China, India, France, South Korea) in pilot stage; Germany, Mexico, UK in development\n\n    - **Adoption Reality Check**: Despite exploration surge, **no new retail CBDCs launched since 2023** (Sand Dollar, eNaira, Jam-Dex). Barriers include:\n      - Lack of public awareness vs existing digital payment convenience\n      - Preference for commercial digital payments (cards, mobile apps)\n      - Infrastructure requirements and digital literacy gaps\n      - Slow user adoption in deployed systems\n\n    - **Cross-Border CBDC**: Project mBridge reached minimum viable product stage, supporting basic functions for real-value wholesale transactions\n\n    - **Key Motivations**: Preserving central bank money role amid cash decline, responding to cryptoasset evolution, financial inclusion, payment efficiency, monetary policy innovation\n\n    - **Regulatory Framework**: UK proposals include holding caps (£10,000-£20,000), no interest bearing, privacy protections aligned with bank account standards\n\n    - **Programmable Money Concerns**: Bank of England confirmed no central bank-initiated programmable functions, but infrastructure enables private sector implementation. Dystopian risks include government spending restrictions (e.g., stimulus usable only for food)\n\n  - ### Money and Blockchain Convergence\n    id:: money-blockchain-convergence\n\n    #### Stablecoin and DeFi Integration [Updated 2025]\n    - **Total Value Locked (TVL)**: DeFi ecosystem reaches $153B (3-year high, July 2025), up 41% YoY\n    - **Ethereum Dominance**: 59.5% of all DeFi TVL on Ethereum, 12% on BNB Chain, 8.4% on Arbitrum\n    - **Top Protocols**: Lido manages $34.8B (liquid staking), 27% of TVL in staking segment\n    - **User Adoption**: 14.2 million active DeFi wallets globally;

likely includes gold, rare metals, potentially Bitcoin hedge\n\n    #### Unbanked and Financial Inclusion\n    - Cryptocurrency adoption higher in emerging markets seeking alternatives\n    - [[Bitcoin]] serves as inflation hedge in high-inflation economies (Argentina, Venezuela)\n    - CBDC pilots in India/Nigeria targeting rural financial inclusion\n    - Cross-border remittances via crypto reducing intermediary costs\n\n  - ### Challenges and Future Directions\n    id:: money-challenges-2025\n\n    #### Regulatory Fragmentation\n    - **USA**: GENIUS Act provides framework;
