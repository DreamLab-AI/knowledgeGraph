(imagebashing).\n\t- ### How to train models?\n\t\t- Smaller data and workflows:\n\t\t\t- Do it yourself with suitable cloud hardware. This applies to all Gen AI.\n\t\t\t- [[LoRA DoRA etc]] are very accessible. Basically nudge the existing models for your requirements.\n\t\t\t- Low legal peril.\n\t\t- Medium scale problems:\n\t\t\t- Own the skills you need for your data / product problem.\n\t\t\t- There's a lot of guidance from the major players like Microsoft\n\t\t\t  [Develop Generative AI solutions with Azure OpenAI Service\n\t\t- Training | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/develop-ai-solutions-azure-openai/)\n\t\t\t- Get in a private consultant like me and onboard the skills for your product / data problem\n\t\t\t- This is the same model a the hub and spokes needed for larger models\n\t\t- Large / complex product and data challenges:\n\t\t\t- The industry is set up around the necessary datacentres. These are centres of excellence, commercial labs, Universities, etc.\n\t\t\t- Engage commercial data team who get you up to speed and train your model on their hardware.\n\t\t\t\t- Salford Uni will doubtless have a strategy with Azure.\n\t\t\t\t- [Deep Learning & Artificial Intelligence SCAN Business | SCAN UK](https://www.scan.co.uk/business/deep-learning)\n\t\t\t\t- [Europe’s largest private AI lab | Silo AI](https://www.silo.ai/)\n\t\t\t\t- [Advanced Solutions Lab Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/asl/)\n\t\t\t\t- Hartree?\n\t- ### Roll out in the cloud.\n\t- Play with [Runpod](https://www.runpod.io/). There's some great [YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjiX3lCnwUI)\n\t- I use a [Lambda Labs H100](https://lambdalabs.com/).\n\t- Unless you really know what you're doing, or you have a LOT of data, I wouldn't buy GPUs and attempt the inferencing side yourself\n\t- ## In Politics.\n\t\t- [An AI Bot Is (Sort of) Running for Mayor in Wyoming | WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-bot-running-for-mayor-wyoming/)\n\t\t- [There’s an AI Candidate Running for Parliament in the UK | WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-candidate-running-for-parliament-uk/)\n\t\t- [[Politics, Law, Privacy]]\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
