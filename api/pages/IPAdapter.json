But, it is very tricky to generate desired images using only text prompt as it often involves complex prompt engineering. An alternative to text prompt is image prompt, as the saying goes: \"an image is worth a thousand words\". Although existing methods of direct fine-tuning from pretrained models are effective, they require large computing resources and are not compatible with other base models, text prompt, and structural controls. In this paper, we present IP-Adapter, an effective and lightweight adapter to achieve image prompt capability for the pretrained text-to-image diffusion models. The key design of our IP-Adapter is decoupled cross-attention mechanism that separates cross-attention layers for text features and image features. Despite the simplicity of our method, an IP-Adapter with only 22M parameters can achieve comparable or even better performance to a fine-tuned image prompt model. As we freeze the pretrained duffusion model, the proposed IP-Adapter can be generalized not only to other custom models fine-tuned from the same base model, but also to controllable generation using existing controllable tools. With the benefit of the decoupled cross-attention strategy, the image prompt can also work well with the text prompt to accomplish multimodal image generation.\n- ## Approach\n  \n  The image prompt adapter is designed to enable a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model to generate images with image prompt. The proposed IP-Adapter consists of two parts: a image encoder to extract image features from image prompt, and adapted modules with decoupled cross-attention to embed image features into the pretrained text-to-image diffusion model.\n  \n  ![](https://ip-adapter.github.io/assets/fig1.png)\n- ## Comparison with Existing Methods\n  \n  The comparison of our proposed IP-Adapter with other methods conditioned on different kinds and styles of images.\n  \n  ![](https://ip-adapter.github.io/assets/result1.jpg)\n- ## More Results\n  \n  **Generalizable to Custom Models**\n  \n  Once the IP-Adapter is trained, it can be directly reusable on custom models fine-tuned from the same base model.\n  \n  ![](https://ip-adapter.github.io/assets/result2.jpg)\n  \n  **Structure Control**\n  \n  The IP-Adapter is fully compatible with existing controllable tools, e.g., ControlNet and T2I-Adapter.\n  \n  ![](https://ip-adapter.github.io/assets/result3.jpg)\n  \n  Our method not only outperforms other methods in terms of image quality, but also produces images that better align with the reference image.\n  \n  ![](https://ip-adapter.github.io/assets/result4.jpg)\n  \n  **Image-to-Image and Inpainting**\n  \n  Image-guided image-to-image and inpainting can be also achieved by simply replacing text prompt with image prompt.\n  \n  ![](https://ip-adapter.github.io/assets/result5.jpg)\n  \n  **Multimodal Prompt**\n  \n  Due to the decoupled cross-attention strategy, image prompt can work together with text prompt to realize multimodal image generation.\n  \n  ![](https://ip-adapter.github.io/assets/result6.jpg)\n  \n  Compared with other existing methods, our method can generate superior results in both image quality and alignment with multimodal prompts.\n  \n  ![](https://ip-adapter.github.io/assets/result7.jpg)\n-\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
