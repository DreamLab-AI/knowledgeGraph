AI is potentially very good at continuous, patient, optimised delivery of education, especially where there is a paucity of skilled teachers. This is a equalising force.\n- Negatives. AI is inherently a closed system, and training people within a closed system which is just a mashup of prior knowledge may have a deleterious impact on the peak creative potential of individuals.\n- Solution. We need to be intentional about a hybrid model, where practitioners bridge the things that AI cannot provide.\n- This is about to be a major new page. It is currently a mess right now but it's next on my list as of Sept 24.\n- {{embed ((666d6535-5da6-4e7c-ae08-624de6a1ee54))}}\n- # Mollick\n  <iframe src=\"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/post-apocalyptic-education\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 600px\"></iframe>\n- # Product research programme\n- I'm working on an InnovateUK-funded programme in a lab in MediaCity. We have money to spend on training people.\n- You have followed this link because you've been specifically invited to [this WhatsApp group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/KwuFsntcsFdHYtPOjnt8EE), where we can lightly kick ideas about. You don't need to say anything in the group. You can come and go as you please. It's mainly friends and family at this stage. You likely know everyone in the room a bit, but anyone can invite anyone they see fit, so bear in mind it's a public forum to a degree.\n- I want to deliver pragmatic, useful tools for teachers, which save time on the organising and admin side of the job, freeing up more time for work-life balance. I have a lot of tricks but I don't know how to apply them to your domains.\n- I am going to run a short and brisk seminar series. The sessions will be 45 minutes, likely starting at 4pm. Likely just four or five of them, on a weekly cadence. Probably Nov/Dec. Might be more early next year.\n- Nothing is yet decided; I want to find the most convenient fit for teachers at all levels.\n- I would initially like to investigate what the open problems are for educators when engaging with AI, and when talking about it to students and colleagues, etc. I need to know what you think the problems are.\n- I want to do at least one group chat between us in Teams, Zoom, or Google or something, and as many 30-minute one-to-one sessions as people can give me to capture specific challenges. These are all optional, and we'll figure out how to do all that in the next few weeks.\n- Once the programme is developed, you'd be welcome to join the formal sessions delivered from the lab. You can promote them in your institutions as something you have had a hand in building, and disseminate the online material as widely as you like.\n- If there's appetite, we might push to physical sessions and there's potentially a bit of (self-reporting into your institution) clout to be had as the council and unis get more involved.\n- The material will eventually end up on these pages and website, which is mine. You can have a [look about](https://narrativegoldmine.com/#/page/introduction%20to%20me) if you like, but it's a distraction to be honest at this stage—everything is a bit too raw to be useful.\n-\n- ## Proposed sessions\n- These are not the final product; they are opening gambits, just to give an idea of my thinking. This is where I would like suggestions.\n- ### Session 1\n\t- How to use my knowledge and tools, in your own time at your own pace, if you want.\n\t- About AI. Myth busting.\n\t- [The Shadow Of The Shape Of The Thing](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/the-shape-of-the-shadow-of-the-thing) – defining the problems of AI in educative settings.\n\t- Feedback and questions.\n- ### Session 2\n\t- [Socratic](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/define-socratic-uses-of-ai-for-.dMRAgsdSwWxdbgRsSZ0LA) uses and the moral mazes.\n\t- Pragmatic uses, and the [secret cyborg](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/secret-cyborgs-the-present-disruption) problem.\n\t- Overview of specific tools.\n\t- Introduction to techniques.\n- ### Session 3\n\t- Deep dive on power techniques.\n\t- Workshop 1 – Prompting techniques.\n- ### Session 4\n\t- Workshop 2 – Diagrams as code.\n\t- Closeout.\n- # Tips for now\n  You should be using [Perplexity.ai](https://perplexity.ai) which gives references.

The future of education with AI looks promising, but it requires a thoughtful, adaptive approach that prioritises the enrichment of the human element in learning.\n- # MollickSmash\n\t- Drawn extensively from [[Ethan Mollick]] who has a Substack called [One Useful Thing](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/).\n\t\t- AI as a Learning and Teaching Tool:\n\t\t- AI, particularly GPT-4, is being effectively used as a tutor and learning aid for students and as a class preparation tool for teachers.\n\t\t- It offers adaptive, useful instruction, enhancing learning while reducing busywork.\n\t- ## Challenges and Opportunities:\n\t\t- The rise of AI raises concerns about cheating and its detection. This is, and will likely remain, undetectable.\n\t\t- However, it also opens doors for innovative teaching methods and aids in simplifying complex topics.\n\t\t- This is analogous to the calculator moment; we should step in, not away from this moment.\n\t- ## AI in Classroom Settings:\n\t\t- AI does not replace the multifaceted role of classroom teaching but complements it by providing support in understanding and applying concepts. It is the infinitely patient follow-up tutorial class. It is the reinforcement learning. It is the mock exams.\n\t\t- Classrooms provide additional value in terms of social interaction, skill application, and instructor support.\n\t- AI and Assignment Types:\n\t\t- AI's rapid adoption challenges traditional assignment types, necessitating a shift towards more interactive and AI-proof methods like oral exams and practical assessments. I don't think that's a bad thing so long as the AI can make time for this change by reducing the busywork.\n\t- Instructor’s Role with AI:\n\t\t- Educators must adapt to the ubiquitous use of AI in classrooms, using it as a tool for feedback, topic suggestions, and concept explanations. It will happen to them sooner or later.\n\t- Pedagogical Implications:\n\t\t- AI offers personalised learning experiences and aids in the application of complex pedagogical approaches.\n\t\t- It allows for new forms of learning and pedagogy that can benefit both instructors and students.\n\t- Future Directions:\n\t\t- AI’s role in education is expected to grow, with increasing integration into teaching methodologies and curricula.\n\t\t- Educators should embrace AI technology and use it creatively in their teaching strategies.\n\t- Adaptive Education System:\n\t\t- The education system is poised to adapt effectively to AI, improving both learning experiences and teaching methodologies. This varies across nations, educational ages, and class boundaries.\n\t- Balancing AI and Traditional Methods:\n\t\t- While AI presents new challenges, it also offers significant opportunities for enhancing education, requiring a balanced approach to its integration. We need to be doing more.\n\t\t- {{embed ((657d1029-63aa-4766-8324-e7d6e5e19001))}}\n\t\t- [[Education and AI]] [(1) Ethan Mollick on X: \"New randomized, controlled trial of students using GPT-4 as a tutor in Nigeria. 6 weeks of after-school AI tutoring = 2 years of typical learning gains, outperforming 80% of other educational interventions.
