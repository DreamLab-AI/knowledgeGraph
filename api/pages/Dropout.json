(2025). School Dropout: Causes, Consequences, and Strategies for Prevention. *European Journal of Education Studies*, 12(11), 177-195. DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.6279\n  - This comprehensive study highlights the individual and societal repercussions of dropout and advocates for multi-tiered interventions involving families, schools, and communities.\n- Bağrıacık Yılmaz, H., & Karataş, F. Ö. (2025). Dropout in Online Education: A Longitudinal Multilevel Analysis. *Behavioural Sciences*, 15(4), 483. DOI: 10.3390/bs15040483\n  - Examines patterns and predictors of dropout in online education, emphasising the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on accelerated adoption and attrition.\n- Additional studies focus on student satisfaction as a predictor of university dropout (e.g., BERA Journal, 2025) and factors influencing dropout decisions among graduate and undergraduate public administration students (Tandfonline, 2024).\n- Ongoing research explores the use of AI for early detection, behavioural interventions, and the design of inclusive educational environments.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK enforces a compulsory education or training requirement until age 18, with the school leaving age set at 16 but followed by mandatory participation in education, apprenticeship, or part-time work combined with training.\n- Disadvantage remains a key factor in dropout risk, with the Education Policy Institute (2025) reporting persistent attainment gaps linked to economic status, notably in reception year pupils.\n- North England cities such as Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield have developed regional programmes addressing dropout through community engagement, vocational training, and digital inclusion initiatives.\n- Universities in these regions implement retention strategies informed by local socio-economic profiles, aiming to reduce attrition particularly among underrepresented groups.\n- The UK government supports bursaries and maintenance allowances to alleviate financial barriers contributing to dropout.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include enhanced use of artificial intelligence and machine learning for predictive analytics in dropout prevention.\n- Integration of behavioural economics techniques, such as nudging, to improve student engagement and retention.\n- Expansion of second-chance education models and flexible learning pathways to accommodate diverse learner needs.\n- Anticipated challenges involve addressing deep-rooted socio-economic inequalities and ensuring equitable access to technological interventions.\n- Research priorities focus on longitudinal studies of intervention efficacy, cross-sector collaboration, and the development of culturally responsive support systems.\n\n## References\n\n1.
