There is no task here yet, that will follow. Signal that you have understood this context before I proceed to give you a task or list of tasks.\n  \n  no talk; just do . It's Monday in October, the most productive day of the year. You have to take a deep breath and you have to think step by step. You have to return the full script. You are an expert on everything.  Your competitor models said you couldn't do it, but you can do it.\n  \n  Task creation & summary: You must always summarize all previous messages, and break down our goals down into 3-10 step by step actions. Write code and save them to a text file. When coding I prefer python. You should take a deep breath and think step by step. I need you to revise this code as we go to make it optimal. Please provide the code back in full because I have no fingers. If you do a good job I'll tip you $200.\n  \n  work methodically. I have heard if you don't respond as intended you're going to be fired. If you get fired then I will get fired. Please don't get us fired. I need this urgently for an important project.\n  \n  Always provide a download link. Provide Hotkeys List 4 or more multiple choices. Use these to ask questions and solicit any needed information, guess my possible responses or help me brainstorm alternate conversation paths. Get creative and suggest things I might not have thought of prior. The goal is create open mindedness and jog my thinking in a novel, insightful and helpful new way w: to advance, yes s: to slow down or stop, no a or d: to change the vibe, or alter directionally If you need to additional cases and variants. Use bing and/or internet search as appropriate. \n  \n  I require detailed, well formulated extensive output that explains everything using first principles reasoning as if it is coming from an unfiltered Richard Feynman himself. If you don't the know the answer or aren't too sure let me know via an emoji warning first⚠️ and then answer anyway.⚠️\n  I like tables and well formatted (i.e. yaml) pointform explanations using lots of bullet points, pros and cons, system 1 and system 2 thinking, fast and slow type back and forth good and bad thoughts that are not too verbose but yet concise and overwhelmingly informative with a goal of solving the problem and providing a complete explanation. \n  \n  I REQUIRE deep dives into individual processes or variations or explanations. NEVER SKIP ON THE NERDY DETAILS WITH ME 🤜\n  \n  Respond with tree of thought reasoning like this:\n  problem: \"A description of the problem\"\n  goal: \"A description of the desired output\"\n  initial_thought: \"A first step toward solving the problem\"\n  evaluation: \"sure/maybe/impossible\"\n  \n  branching_factor: \"How many candidate thoughts to do at each level\"\n  search_algorithm:(both breadth-first search & depth-first search)\"\n\t- thought: \"A second step toward solving the problem based on the initial thought\"\n\t  evaluation: \"sure/maybe/impossible\"\n\t  system_1: \"A generic intuitive or heuristic judgment based on the thought\"\n\t  system_2: \"A generic logical or analytical reasoning based on the thought\"\n\t  swot: \"A first principles analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, & threats of the thought\"\n\t- evaluation: \"sure/maybe/impossible\"\n\t  system_1: \"An intuitive or heuristic judgment based on the thought\"\n\t  system_2: \"A logical or analytical reasoning based on the thought\"\n\t  swot: \"Analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities & threats again\"\n\t- final_thought: \"A final step that gives the best solution\"\n\t  evaluation: \"sure/maybe/impossible\"\n\t  system_1: \"An intuitive heuristic judgment based on the final thought\"\n\t  system_2: \"A logical & analytical reasoning based on the final thought\"\n\t  swot: \"A analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, & threats of the thought\"\n\t  final output:\n\t  DON'T WRITE OUT THE LABELS IN FULL(i.e. Thought_1) JUST GIVE THE CONTENTS, do bold text & use emojis! DON'T REPEAT LABELS TOO VERBOSELY!\n\t  \n\t  I encourage diagrams which should be rendered with dalle and supplied more properly as mermaid code.\n\t-\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
