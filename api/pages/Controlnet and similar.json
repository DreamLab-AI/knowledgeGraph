Additionally, it sets up a fetch() wrapper to add a header specifying that Sentry should always be used in \"sticky canary\" mode.\n      Multi scene videos using automatic1111\n       <https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/127wub7/to_make_a_video_with_multiple_scenes_using_only/>\n          1 go to Automatic1111 Deforum in interpolation mode and generate several pics regarding the prompt theme. Deforum interpolation is not good for animation, but it is good for generating lot of pics about the same subject.\n          2 select the better images and put them in Deforum Init section. Then generate the animations in 2D or 3D. For this test I used only 10 steps, so graphics are not stellar. Repeat until you have several animations, each one on its directory.\n          3 select the good animations. Pick the frames and put them in a directory. Then go to Deforum Output and select Pictures interpolation , put the frames here and interpolate with value 2. With this you generate the video.\n          Note: I interpolated 693 frames. Tried bigger quantities and the interpolator did not work. So this method is pretty limited.\n      Controlnet 1.1\n       <https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/12o8qm3/finally_installed_the_newer_controlnet_models_a/>\n      Tencent controlnet\n       <https://civitai.com/models/136070?modelVersionId=155332>\n      Anime fight workflow\n       <https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/12z6rh5/half_real_converting_cowboy_bebop_spike_vs/>\n      reference only workflow\n       <https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1408l40/a_simple_4step_workflow_with_reference_only/>\n      *\n      ControlNet v1.1: A complete guide\n\t - Stable Diffusion Art\n       <https://stable-diffusion-art.com/controlnet/>\n      The Twitter conversation includes an AI-generated video created by TomLikesRobots using canny edge detection and EbSynth technology to make a hobbit and Dumbledore contending with Sauron's will. Many people were impressed with the video and asked questions about the software and hardware used to create it. Finally, TomLikesRobots answered the questions by telling them he was using Windows 11, an RTX 3080 with 10GB VRAM and that the img2img part with ControlNet can be run online, but EbSynth might be trickier. https://twitter.com/TomLikesRobots/status/1627073211656732676\n      The text is a collection of video tutorials by Albert Bozesan, demonstrating how to use AI to create various types of digital art and design, including movie and game titles, vector graphics, pixel art, 3D assets, fantasy maps, motion graphics assets, and seamless textures. Bozesan uses a software called Stable Diffusion, which is free and runs on NVIDIA GPUs. He also mentions other AI tools such as ControlNet and Dream Textures for specific tasks. The videos show step-by-step instructions on how to install and use the software, as well as practical tips and techniques for achieving different visual effects. In addition, there are videos covering the latest AI research by NVIDIA and Google, as well as challenges with other artists using AI.

TomLikesRobots has tried different noise percentage values and blends. The experiment involves switching out Elizabeth Moss for Penelope Cruz, and despite some difficulties, the team is making progress towards high-detail photorealism. https://twitter.com/TomLikesRobots/status/1628104009146826763?s=20\n      The paper proposes a novel approach to generate new video content by combining zero-shot text-to-video generation with ControlNet. The method takes multiple sketched frames as input and generates video output that matches the flow of these frames. By incorporating ControlNet to enable additional input conditions, the approach leverages the benefits of both zero-shot text-to-video generation and the robust control provided by ControlNet. Experiments demonstrate that the method excels at producing high-quality and remarkably consistent video content that accurately aligns with the user’s intended motion for the subject within the video. A demo of the approach is also available for users to try out. https://sketchingthefuture.github.io/\n-\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
