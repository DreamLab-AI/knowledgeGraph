The North England context remains limited because eclipse attack research and implementation clusters do not currently concentrate in that region—a fact worth noting rather than fabricating. The entry now emphasises that eclipse attacks represent a solved problem in principle (mitigations exist) but an ongoing challenge in practice (adoption remains incomplete).\n\n\n## Metadata\n\n\n- **Migration Status**: Ontology block enriched on 2025-11-12\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-12\n- **Review Status**: Comprehensive editorial review\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
