This approach implements encryption schemes where operations on encrypted data produce encrypted results that, when decrypted, match results of operations on plaintext, formalized as Decrypt(Encrypt(m1) ⊕ Encrypt(m2)) = m1 + m2 for addition and Decrypt(Encrypt(m1) ⊗ Encrypt(m2)) = m1 × m2 for multiplication. Scheme types include partially homomorphic encryption supporting only addition (Paillier) or only multiplication (RSA), somewhat homomorphic encryption permitting limited operations before noise accumulation requires decryption, and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enabling arbitrary computations on encrypted data through bootstrapping refreshing ciphertexts to control noise growth, implemented in schemes like BGV, BFV for integer arithmetic, and CKKS for approximate arithmetic on real/complex numbers suitable for machine learning. ML applications include encrypted inference where clients encrypt inputs, servers perform encrypted prediction, and clients decrypt results without server seeing plaintext data, federated learning with clients encrypting model updates before aggregation preventing coordinator privacy breaches, and collaborative training enabling multiple parties to jointly train models on combined encrypted datasets without exposing individual contributions. The 2024-2025 period witnessed homomorphic encryption mature sufficiently for commercial deployment with Microsoft's SEAL library and IBM's HELib enabling encrypted computation, Intel SGX and ARM TrustZone providing hardware-backed confidential computing, and sectors including healthcare, finance, and government adopting PPML for regulatory-compliant training on sensitive data, though substantial challenges remained including 10-100x computational overhead compared to plaintext operations, complexity of parameter selection balancing security and performance, and limited operation support with neural network architectures requiring approximations.\n    - maturity:: mature\n    - source:: [[Microsoft SEAL]], [[IBM HELib]], [[CKKS Scheme]]\n    - authority-score:: 0.95\n\n  - **Semantic Classification**\n    - owl:class:: aigo:HomomorphicEncryptionML\n    - owl:physicality:: VirtualEntity\n    - owl:role:: Process\n    - owl:inferred-class:: aigo:VirtualProcess\n    - belongsToDomain:: [[AIEthicsDomain]]\n    - implementedInLayer:: [[ConceptualLayer]]\n\n  - #### Relationships\n    id:: homomorphic-encryption-for-machine-learning-relationships\n\n  - #### OWL Axioms\n    id:: homomorphic-encryption-for-machine-learning-owl-axioms\n    collapsed:: true\n    - ```clojure\n      \n      ```\n\n- ## About Homomorphic Encryption for Machine Learning\n  id:: homomorphic-encryption-for-machine-learning-about\n\n  - \n  -\n    - ### Use Cases\n  - ### Healthcare\n  -\n    **Encrypted Medical Diagnosis**:\n  -\n    **Scenario**: Cloud-based diagnosis without revealing patient data\n  -\n    ```python\n    # Hospital encrypts patient record\n    patient_data_enc = encrypt_vector(patient_features, public_key)\n  -\n    # Cloud runs encrypted inference\n    diagnosis_enc = encrypted_neural_network(patient_data_enc)\n  -\n    # Hospital decrypts result\n    diagnosis = decrypt(diagnosis_enc, private_key)\n    ```\n  -\n    **Benefits**:\n    - HIPAA compliance\n    - Cloud scalability\n    - Zero data exposure\n  -\n    **Genomic Privacy**:\n    - Encrypted genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\n    - Private variant analysis\n    - Secure biobank queries\n    -\n  - ### Best Practices\n  - ### Parameter Selection\n  -\n    **Security Level**:\n    - λ = 128 bits (standard)\n    - λ = 192 or 256 bits (high security)\n  -\n    **Polynomial Degree**:\n    - 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384\n    - Larger = more security + batching, but slower\n  -\n    **CKKS Scale**:\n    - Balance precision vs. ciphertext size\n    - Typically 2^40 to 2^60\n  -\n    **Example** (TenSEAL):\n    ```python\n    context = ts.context(\n        ts.SCHEME_TYPE.CKKS,\n        poly_modulus_degree=8192,  # Security + batching\n        coeff_mod_bit_sizes=[60, 40, 40, 40, 60]  # Levels\n    )\n    context.global_scale = 2**40  # Precision\n    ```\n\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
