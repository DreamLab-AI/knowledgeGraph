Unlike other commodities, precious metals maintained their value even when more technologically advanced societies attempted to debase them by mixing in other metals. This durability was due to the metals’ scarcity and the difficulty of acquiring more even with modern mining techniques.\n\t\t- To enhance the use of precious metals as money, layers were added on top. The creation of coinage allowed the weight and purity of raw metalsto be verified. Coins also blended the intrinsic value of metals withthe authority of the institutions issuing them. Legal tender laws mandated the acceptance of certain coinages for debt repayment.\n\t\t- The emergence of paper money and banking provided another layer of enhancement. Paper banknotes initially facilitated long distance trade by avoiding the need to physically move heavy metals. This evolved from bilateral credit channels between specific parties to broadcast systems where banknotes could circulate among many holders. Banknotes increased transferability and divisibility of money without moving the underlying metals.\n\t\t- Debates arose between the credit and commodity theories of money. The credit theory views money as a shared ledger, with value derived from the authority of the issuer. In contrast, the commodity theory sees money emerge naturally due to the properties of the underlying commodity. Disagreements still center on the role of the state and whether money requires intrinsic value.\n\t\t- Alden thinks that over time, flaws became apparent in state controlled monetary regimes. The ability to non-transparently tax through inflation and currency debasement led to the degradation of monetary systems. Most state currencies have experienced high inflation or hyperinflation. They survive due to lack of alternatives rather than soundness.Commodity-based monies constrained state overreach and lasted longer before breaking down.\n\t- Jesse Myers has an excellent in depth post on the [origins of money and the connection to Bitcoin](https://www.onceinaspecies.com/p/once-in-a-species-73b) as the \"apex predator\" of commodity collectible acting as money.

Works like these feel like they are fitting priors to research, seeking justification for Bitcoin as a money, but it seems possible that more work will be done.\n\n\t\t- ### Message Exchange and Session Management:\n\t\t\t- **Session establishment:** When initiating a DM, the sender and receiver perform a Diffie-Hellman key exchange to establish the root chain and initialise their respective ratchet states.\n\t\t\t- **Message encryption:** The sender uses the sending chain to derive a new ephemeral key, encrypts the message, and sends it as a Nostr event.\n\t\t\t- **Message decryption:** The receiver uses the receiving chain to derive the corresponding ephemeral key and decrypt the message. The receiving chain ratchets forward, updating its state for future messages.\n\n\t- ## State Validation\n\t\t- RGB employs a dual-layer validation process to ensure the integrity and compliance of contract states:\n\t\t- ![photo_2023-12-05_02-42-41.jpg](assets/photo_2023-12-05_02-42-41_1713719951228_0.jpg)\n\n\t- ### Definition\n\t\t- **Components**: Includes state types, data types for constructing states, permissible operations, and their effects on state.\n\t\t- **Importance**: Separates contract developers from issuers, allowing issuers to create assets based on predefined templates without deep technical knowledge.\n\n\t- ### Role and Functionality\n\t\t- **Definition**: An interface provides a standardized set of operations and state information, making contracts understandable to external software.\n\t\t- **Examples**: `RGB20` for fungible assets, `RGB21` for NFTs, each defining operations like transfer, issue, or burn.\n\n\t\t- ### State of Nature and Leviathan\n\t - **AI as a Disruptive Force:** Discusses how AI, like historical technological advancements, has the potential to be a disruptive force, reshaping societal structures, power dynamics, and individual lives.\n\t - **Historical Analogies:** Draws parallels between AI's potential impacts and historical events like the English Civil War, emphasizing the transformative role of technology in societal upheaval.\n\n\t- ## The Omega Point Interpretation\n\t\t- The Omega Point, as conceived by French Jesuit priest and palaeontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, represents a future state of maximum complexity and consciousness, towards which the universe is evolving.\n\t\t- Kurzweil argues that the singularity is not an impenetrable boundary but rather a point of transition, beyond which intelligence and technology will continue to evolve and expand, ultimately leading to a state of unprecedented possibilities.\n\t\t- The Omega Point interpretation allows for a greater degree of human agency and participation in the process of reaching the singularity and shaping the future beyond it.\n\t\t- This perspective suggests that through the merger of human intelligence with advanced technology, we can actively shape and direct the future evolution of consciousness and complexity.\n\n\t\t\t- # Mamba2: A Deep Dive into Enhanced Efficiency and Scalability\n\t\t\t\t- [Mamba2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21060) represents a significant advancement in the realm of structured state space models (SSMs), cleverly marrying theoretical elegance with practical efficiency. Building upon the foundation laid by its predecessor, Mamba, this architecture tackles the inherent computational challenges of sequence modelling, particularly for long sequences, by introducing a series of innovations that leverage the power of modern hardware. This section delves into the technical intricacies of Mamba2, guided by the insights from the paper \"Transformers are SSMs: Generalised Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality\".\n\n- # 2025 State of Consumer AI Report by Menlo Ventures\n\t- [Menlo Ventures’ 2025 State of Consumer AI Report Reveals](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/06/11/3045687/0/en/Menlo-Ventures-2025-State-of-Consumer-AI-Report-Reveals-Widespread-Adoption-but-Monetization-Lags.html)\n\t\t- Nearly one in five Americans use AI every day.\n\t\t- AI usage is prevalent across all generations, with millennials leading in daily use at 24%.\n\n\t\t- ### Checkpoint and Resume Strategy\n\t\t\t- Implement systematic progress tracking:\n\t\t\t\t- Force agents to document their current state and progress\n\t\t\t\t- Save this information to persistent storage (files, databases)\n\t\t\t\t- Start new conversations with context from these checkpoints\n\t\t\t\t- Maintain to-do lists that the agent must update and reference\n\n\t- ## State Validation\n\t\t- RGB employs a dual-layer validation process to ensure the integrity and compliance of contract states:\n\t\t- ![photo_2023-12-05_02-42-41.jpg](assets/photo_2023-12-05_02-42-41_1713719951228_0.jpg)\n\n\t- ### Definition\n\t\t- **Components**: Includes state types, data types for constructing states, permissible operations, and their effects on state.\n\t\t- **Importance**: Separates contract developers from issuers, allowing issuers to create assets based on predefined templates without deep technical knowledge.\n\t\t          global_types: Map<TypeIdentifier, TypeName>,\n\t\t          own_types: Map<TypeIdentifier, TypeName>,\n\t\t          // Additional fields defining operations and their structure...\n\t\t      }\n\n\t- ### Role and Functionality\n\t\t- **Definition**: An interface provides a standardized set of operations and state information, making contracts understandable to external software.\n\t\t- **Examples**: `RGB20` for fungible assets, `RGB21` for NFTs, each defining operations like transfer, issue, or burn.\n\n\t- ## Three Possible Futures id:: 65929cb3-95b4-454b-8c9e-7ae231aec377\n\t - **State Surveillance and Control:** Explores the potential for states to extend their surveillance capabilities and tighten control over citizens using advanced AI, leading to an Orwellian future where privacy is virtually nonexistent.\n\t - **Implications for Society:** Discusses how the decentralization of authority and the rise of powerful private entities could shape societal norms, governance, and daily life, leading to a redefinition of citizenship, rights, and [[Social contract and jobs]]. He identifies Uber as a social credit system which we blithely accept. Over time this trends to separation like that seen in the insurance markets, where \"all the 1 star Uber drivers drive the 1 star passenger\", but writ large across society. This is also \"gated communities\" and the micro-states defended by AI as posited by authors like Neal Stephenson in Diamond Age.\n\t - **Adversarial Renaissance:** This might well be dystopian, but equally it could be a renaissance moment, with national governments losing their hegemonic control to exascale compute powered conglomerates, city states, micro countries etc. This is for sure more adversarial, but not **necessarily** bad. This is a libertarian viewpoint, but also perhaps a classic liberal one.\n\n\t- ## The Omega Point Interpretation\n\t\t- The Omega Point, as conceived by French Jesuit priest and palaeontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, represents a future state of maximum complexity and consciousness, towards which the universe is evolving.\n\t- The current moment can be seen as a boundary condition in both the Event Horizon and Omega Point interpretations.\n\t- In the Event Horizon interpretation, this boundary represents a point beyond which the future becomes unknowable and unpredictable due to the rapid acceleration of technological progress.\n\t- In the Omega Point interpretation, the event horizon represents a critical point in the trajectory towards the Omega Point, beyond which the future becomes increasingly determined by the merger of human intelligence and advanced technology.\n\n- # 2025 State of Consumer AI Report by Menlo Ventures\n\n\t\t- ### Implementation Patterns\n\t\t\t- Effective deep research systems:\n\t\t\t\t- Break complex queries into constituent questions\n\t\t\t\t- Force agents to document their current state and progress\n\t\t\t\t- Save this information to persistent storage (files, databases)\n\t\t\t\t- Start new conversations with context from these checkpoints\n\t\t\t\t- Maintain to-do lists that the agent must update and reference\n\n\t- ### Definition\n\t\t- **Components**: Includes state types, data types for constructing states, permissible operations, and their effects on state.\n\t\t      }\n\n\t- ### Role and Functionality\n\t\t- **Definition**: An interface provides a standardized set of operations and state information, making contracts understandable to external software.\n\t\t- **Examples**: `RGB20` for fungible assets, `RGB21` for NFTs, each defining operations like transfer, issue, or burn.\n\n\t- ### Definition\n\t\t- **Components**: Includes state types, data types for constructing states, permissible operations, and their effects on state.\n\t\t      }\n\n- #### 4.12.7 Uncontrolled AGI Creation\n  On the other hand, some suggest that capitalist competition could result in the creation of AGI that cannot be controlled.
