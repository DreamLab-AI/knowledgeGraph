It is a powerful tool for creating AI-generated animations and has become very popular in the AI art community.\n- ## How it Works\n\t- AnimateDiff works by adding a motion modeling module to a stable diffusion model. This module is trained on a large dataset of videos and learns to predict the motion between frames. When you provide AnimateDiff with an image and a text prompt, it uses the motion modeling module to generate a sequence of frames that create an animation.\n- ## Features\n\t- **Text-to-Video:** Generate animations from a text prompt and a static image.\n\t- **Image-to-Video:** Generate animations from a static image.\n\t- **Video-to-Video:** Transfer the style of one video to another.\n\t- **ControlNet:** Use ControlNet to guide the animation and create more complex movements.\n\t- **LoRA:** Use LoRA to fine-tune the model and create specific styles.\n- ## Resources\n\t- ### GitHub Repositories\n\t\t- [guoyww/animatediff](https://github.com/guoyww/animatediff) -
