This expanded entry contextualises ROC curves within contemporary machine learning practice, acknowledges their limitations (particularly regarding imbalanced datasets), incorporates UK and North England examples with appropriate specificity, and provides complete academic citations. The nested bullet format enhances navigability whilst maintaining technical precision. Humour has been employed sparingly—the observation about \"random guessing\" and the implicit irony of threshold selection complexity should resonate with practitioners without undermining rigour.\n\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-11\n- **Review Status**: Comprehensive editorial review\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
