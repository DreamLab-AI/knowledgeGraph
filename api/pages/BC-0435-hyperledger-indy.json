Developed under the [[Hyperledger Foundation]] umbrella and initially contributed by the [[Sovrin Foundation]], Indy implements [[Decentralized Identifiers]] (DIDs) conforming to [[W3C]] standards and [[Verifiable Credentials]] enabling cryptographic proof of claims without revealing underlying personal data. Unlike general-purpose blockchains, Indy specifically addresses identity use cases through privacy-preserving cryptography including [[Zero-Knowledge Proofs]], [[Anonymous Credentials]], and [[Selective Disclosure]], allowing credential holders to prove specific attributes (such as being over 18 or holding a university degree) without revealing unnecessary personal information or creating correlatable identifiers across different verifiers. The Indy ledger stores only public DIDs, credential schemas, credential definitions, and revocation registries, with personally identifiable information remaining off-chain under individual control in digital wallets. This architecture addresses fundamental privacy concerns with traditional identity systems where centralised identity providers create surveillance risks, data breach vulnerabilities, and single points of failure. Major production deployments include the [[Sovrin Network]], a global public-permissioned network for identity transactions, [[Verifiable Organizations Network]] (VON) pioneered by the [[Government of British Columbia]] enabling businesses to issue and verify official credentials, and numerous enterprise implementations in healthcare, financial services, and education sectors. Hyperledger Indy works in conjunction with [[Hyperledger Aries]] providing protocols and frameworks for building SSI applications, and [[Hyperledger Ursa]] supplying shared cryptographic libraries. The technology enables use cases including portable professional credentials, patient-controlled medical records, digital travel documents, supply chain identity verification, and regulatory compliance systems requiring privacy-preserving identity verification whilst fundamentally shifting control from centralised institutions to individuals and organisations managing their own identity information.\n\n  - ### Technical Architecture\n    - Hyperledger Indy implements a layered architecture separating the distributed ledger layer storing public identity infrastructure from the credential exchange layer handling peer-to-peer interactions between credential issuers, holders, and verifiers. The ledger utilises [[Plenum]] Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus algorithm optimised for identity transactions, with validator nodes called stewards operating the network according to governance frameworks. The architecture distinguishes between public DIDs written to the ledger and peer DIDs used for private pairwise relationships, minimising correlation risks whilst enabling verifiable claims. [[Anoncreds]] (Anonymous Credentials) cryptographic scheme based on [[CL Signatures]] (Camenisch-Lysyanskaya) enables zero-knowledge proofs where credential holders prove possession of valid credentials and selective attributes without revealing credential contents or creating linkable identifiers.\n    - Key components:\n      - [[Decentralized Identifiers]] (DIDs) - Globally unique identifiers with associated DID Documents containing public keys, service endpoints, and authentication mechanisms, enabling cryptographic verification without centralised registries. Indy implements DID Method Specification `did:indy` and previously `did:sov` for Sovrin Network\n      - [[Verifiable Credentials]] - Tamper-evident credentials with cryptographic proofs issued by trusted entities, held by individuals in digital wallets, and presented to verifiers without contacting issuers. Credentials contain claims (attributes) about subjects, with schemas defining structure published to ledger enabling verification\n      - [[Anoncreds]] and [[Zero-Knowledge Proofs]] - Privacy-preserving credential presentation where holders prove predicates (age > 18, degree earned before 2020) without revealing actual attribute values, using cryptographic proofs preventing correlation across presentations through different blinded secrets per presentation\n      - [[Revocation Registries]] - Cryptographic accumulators enabling credential revocation checks without revealing which specific credentials were verified, maintaining privacy whilst allowing verifiers to confirm credentials remain valid. Indy implements efficient revocation through tails files and witness updates\n      - [[Credential Schemas and Definitions]] - Public ledger objects defining credential structure (schema) and cryptographic parameters for issuance (credential definition), enabling anyone to verify credentials without prior coordination with issuers\n      - [[Agents and Wallets]] - Software components managing DIDs, keys, and credentials for individuals and organisations, with secure storage for private keys and credentials. [[Hyperledger Aries]] provides agent frameworks implementing DIDComm protocols for secure, authenticated communication\n      - [[Steward Nodes]] - Validator nodes operating Indy ledgers under governance frameworks, selected through application processes ensuring geographic distribution, organisational diversity, and technical capability, typically requiring permissioned membership unlike public blockchains\n\n  - ### Key Features and Capabilities\n    - **Self-Sovereign Identity Control**: Hyperledger Indy fundamentally shifts identity control from centralised authorities to individuals and organisations managing their own identifiers and credentials. Unlike federated identity systems relying on identity providers like [[Google]] or [[Facebook]], or centralised government identity systems, SSI enables individuals to hold credentials in personal wallets, selectively share attributes based on context, and maintain relationships without intermediaries. Credential issuers cannot track when or where holders present credentials, eliminating surveillance capabilities inherent in centralised systems. This architecture implements privacy-by-design principles where unnecessary data collection is technically prevented rather than merely discouraged.\n    - **Interoperability through Standards**: Indy implements [[W3C Decentralized Identifier]] specification and [[W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model]], ensuring interoperability with other SSI systems and enabling credential portability across platforms. The [[DID:Indy Method Specification]] defines how DIDs map to Indy ledgers, whilst [[Aries Interop Profiles]] ensure agent implementations from different vendors communicate successfully. This standards-based approach prevents vendor lock-in and enables ecosystem development where credential issuers, wallet providers, and verification services compete whilst maintaining technical compatibility. Integration with [[European Blockchain Services Infrastructure]] (EBSI) and other national digital identity initiatives demonstrates standards enabling cross-border credential recognition.\n    - **Privacy-Preserving Credential Presentation**: [[Anoncreds]] implementation enables sophisticated privacy preservation through selective disclosure and predicate proofs. Credential holders prove specific claims without revealing complete credentials, presenting only necessary attributes whilst keeping other information private. [[Zero-Knowledge Proofs]] enable proving mathematical relationships (age greater than threshold, salary within range) without disclosing actual values. Each credential presentation uses different cryptographic blinding preventing correlation across verifiers, addressing privacy risks where multiple presentations of the same credential create tracking opportunities. This capability is essential for regulatory compliance scenarios requiring identity verification without creating comprehensive personal data profiles.\n    - **Distributed Trust through Decentralisation**: Indy ledgers eliminate single points of failure and centralised control through distributed validator networks. No single organisation controls the ledger or can unilaterally modify identity records, with Byzantine fault tolerant consensus requiring agreement amongst validator majority. This architecture resists censorship where authoritarian regimes or commercial entities might disable centralised identity systems, providing resilience critical for human rights applications. Governance frameworks define validator selection, network upgrades, and dispute resolution through transparent processes involving diverse stakeholders rather than unilateral corporate or governmental control.\n\n  - ### Industry Applications\n    - **Government Identity and Business Registration**: The [[Verifiable Organizations Network]] (VON) pioneered by the [[Government of British Columbia]] represents the first production government deployment of Hyperledger Indy, enabling businesses to obtain verifiable credentials for registrations, permits, and licences. [[OrgBook BC]] publishes verifiable credentials for over 525,000 legal entities, enabling instant verification of business legitimacy, incorporation status, and regulatory compliance without manual processes or centralised databases. Other government jurisdictions can verify British Columbia business credentials cryptographically, creating trusted cross-border business relationships.\n      - Implementation details: British Columbia corporate registry issues [[Verifiable Credentials]] when businesses incorporate or renew registrations, with credentials containing business name, incorporation number, status, and other public information. Businesses receive credentials in digital wallets, presenting them to banks for account opening, suppliers for credit applications, or government agencies for permit applications. Verifiers check credential cryptographic proofs and revocation status against Indy ledger without contacting the corporate registry, enabling instant verification 24/7 whilst protecting business privacy through selective disclosure.\n      - Benefits achieved: Elimination of manual business verification processes, reduction in identity fraud and business impersonation, instant credential verification versus days for manual registry searches, portable business credentials usable across jurisdictions, reduced administrative burden for businesses repeatedly proving identity\n      - [[Hyperledger Aries]] agent framework, [[OrgBook]] open-source verifiable credential directory, [[The Org Book]] by [[Government of Ontario]]\n    - **Healthcare Identity and Patient Data Control**: Healthcare implementations of Hyperledger Indy enable patient-controlled medical records where individuals hold verifiable credentials for medical qualifications, insurance coverage, prescriptions, and test results whilst controlling access granularly. [[Digital Health Pass]] initiatives developed during COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated credential verification for vaccination status, test results, and health declarations whilst preserving privacy through selective disclosure and preventing central tracking of individuals' movements.\n      - Implementation details: Healthcare providers, laboratories, and vaccination centres issue [[Verifiable Credentials]] for medical procedures, test results, and vaccinations directly to patient digital wallets. Patients present credentials to employers, airlines, venues, or healthcare providers requiring proof of specific health attributes without revealing complete medical history. [[Zero-Knowledge Proofs]] enable proving vaccination status or test results within timeframe without disclosing exact dates or locations. Credential revocation enables updating status if test results change or credentials expire.\n      - Benefits achieved: Patient data ownership and control, privacy-preserving health status verification, interoperability across healthcare providers without centralised databases, reduced identity fraud in prescription systems, rapid credential verification for travel and event access, elimination of paper-based vaccination cards\n      - [[HIPAA]] compliance through privacy preservation, [[SMART Health Cards]] integration, [[Vaccination Credential Initiative]]\n    - **Education Credentials and Professional Licences**: Universities, professional bodies, and certification organisations issue digital credentials on Hyperledger Indy enabling graduates and professionals to prove qualifications instantly without contacting issuing institutions. [[Blockcerts]] and similar initiatives demonstrate academic credential verification, whilst professional licensing boards issue verifiable credentials for medical licences, legal credentials, and trade certifications.\n      - Implementation details: Universities issue [[Verifiable Credentials]] upon graduation containing degree information, graduation date, and student attributes, signed by university's DID and stored in graduate's wallet. Employers verify credentials cryptographically without contacting university, checking credential validity and revocation status against Indy ledger. Selective disclosure enables proving degree earned without revealing graduation date, GPA, or other attributes. Professional associations issue continuing education credentials, licence renewals, and membership status as verifiable credentials enabling instant verification by clients or regulatory bodies.\n      - Benefits achieved: Elimination of transcript request processes, prevention of credential fraud and diploma mills, instant employment verification, portable professional credentials across jurisdictions, reduced administrative costs for credential verification, enabling micro-credentials and alternative education providers\n      - [[Comprehensive Learner Record]], [[European Diploma Supplement]], [[Digital Credentials Consortium]]\n\n  - ### Standards and Governance\n    - **Standards**: Hyperledger Indy implements and contributes to international identity standards ensuring interoperability and industry adoption. [[W3C Decentralized Identifier]] (DID) specification defines DID syntax, resolution, and DID Document structure, with Indy implementing `did:indy` method specification. [[W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model]] standardises credential format, proof mechanisms, and presentation protocols. [[DIDComm]] messaging protocol enables secure, authenticated communication between agents using DIDs rather than traditional identifiers. The [[Trust over IP Foundation]] develops trust frameworks and governance models for SSI ecosystems, with Indy as reference implementation. [[European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework]] (eSSIF) builds upon Indy and Aries for European digital identity initiatives.\n    - **Governance models**: Indy ledgers operate under explicitly defined governance frameworks specifying validator selection, network rules, upgrade procedures, and dispute resolution. The [[Sovrin Network]] implements tiered governance with Sovrin Board of Trustees setting policy, Technical Governance Board managing technical decisions, and Stewards operating validator nodes under legal agreements. Steward organisations include universities, enterprises, non-profits, and government agencies providing geographic and organisational diversity. [[VON]] governance involves Canadian provincial and federal government agencies collaborating on network operation and evolution. Governance frameworks address validator incentives (typically altruistic or aligned with participants' missions rather than financial), permissioned validator admission processes ensuring network quality, and transparent decision-making preventing unilateral control.\n    - **Compliance**: Hyperledger Indy's privacy-preserving architecture inherently supports regulatory compliance with data protection frameworks including [[GDPR]], [[CCPA]], and [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]] (PIPEDA). Since personally identifiable information remains off-chain in individual-controlled wallets rather than stored in centralised databases, data controllers avoid many compliance obligations. Credential issuers need not track credential usage, reducing surveillance and data retention requirements. Right to erasure is simplified as individuals control their credential storage and can delete wallet contents without requiring centralised data deletion. However, compliance complexity exists where public DIDs and credential schemas persist immutably on ledger, requiring careful design ensuring no PII appears in public records. [[KYC]] and [[AML]] compliance in financial services requires identity verification whilst preserving privacy, addressed through selective disclosure proving identity verification status without revealing underlying personal data to all parties.\n\n  - ### Comparison with Alternatives\n    - Compared to [[Centralised Identity Providers]]: Hyperledger Indy eliminates single points of failure, surveillance risks, and vendor lock-in inherent in centralised systems like [[Google Sign-In]], [[Facebook Connect]], or national identity databases. Centralised providers track all credential usage creating privacy concerns and attractive targets for data breaches, whilst Indy's architecture prevents credential issuers from tracking presentations. However, centralised systems benefit from simpler user experience, ubiquitous adoption, and mature recovery mechanisms when users lose credentials. Centralised providers often offer free services to users whilst monetising data, versus Indy requiring individuals to manage wallet software and backup procedures.\n    - Compared to [[Federated Identity Systems]]: Federated identity like [[SAML]] or [[OAuth]]/[[OpenID Connect]] enables single sign-on across multiple services but requires real-time communication with identity providers for each authentication, creating tracking opportunities and dependency on provider availability. Indy enables offline credential verification without contacting issuers, providing privacy and resilience advantages. Federated systems benefit from mature standards and widespread enterprise deployment, whilst Indy SSI ecosystem is earlier in adoption curve with fewer credential issuers and verifiers. Federation works well for enterprise single sign-on but creates inappropriate dependencies for person-to-person or government-to-citizen interactions where Indy excels.\n    - When to use Hyperledger Indy: Choose Indy for identity use cases requiring privacy preservation, individual control over personal data, offline verification capability, or regulatory compliance with data minimisation principles. Applications include government credentials, healthcare records, professional licences, and supply chain identity where surveillance risks and data breach concerns outweigh centralised convenience. Centralised or federated identity remains appropriate for internal enterprise authentication, high-transaction volume consumer applications requiring simplicity, or scenarios where credential issuer tracking provides security benefits.\n\n  - ### Implementation Considerations\n    - **Technical requirements**: Implementing Hyperledger Indy requires distributed systems expertise, cryptographic understanding, and specialised SSI knowledge. Infrastructure needs for network operators include validator node hosting requiring high availability, network connectivity, and security hardening, typically deployed on cloud infrastructure or enterprise data centres. Application developers need Hyperledger Aries agent frameworks supporting multiple programming languages including [[Python]], [[JavaScript]], [[.NET]], and [[Go]], with SDKs abstracting Indy ledger interactions. Wallet solutions require secure key storage potentially using device secure enclaves like [[iOS Keychain]] or [[Android KeyStore]]. Development teams must understand cryptographic concepts including DIDs, verifiable credentials, zero-knowledge proofs, and revocation registries, with learning curve steeper than traditional authentication systems.\n    - **Organisational readiness**: Organisations implementing SSI must educate stakeholders about self-sovereign identity concepts fundamentally different from centralised identity paradigms. Credential issuers need policies defining what credentials to issue, when to revoke, and how to manage schema evolution. Governance frameworks must address liability when credentials are compromised, processes for individuals losing wallet access, and procedures for revoking credentials in emergencies. User experience design is critical as individuals managing private keys and wallets face complexity requiring careful interface design and user education. Change management addresses shifting from centralised identity control to distributed models where organisations lose visibility into credential usage.\n    - **Cost considerations**: Hyperledger Indy implementation costs vary significantly based on deployment model. Network operators running steward nodes incur infrastructure costs (£2,000-£10,000 monthly per validator node), staffing for operations, and legal/governance participation. Application developers building credential issuers, verifiers, or wallet applications face development costs (£50,000-£500,000 depending on complexity), ongoing maintenance, and user support. Transaction costs on Indy ledgers are typically zero or nominal (measured in tokens with minimal fiat value) unlike public blockchains with significant gas fees. Organisations joining existing networks like Sovrin avoid infrastructure costs but may pay transaction fees or membership fees. Wallet providers incur development and hosting costs whilst typically offering free basic services to individuals and monetising enterprise features.\n    - **Timeline**: Hyperledger Indy projects require 6-24 months from conception to production deployment depending on scope and organisational readiness. Timeline includes 2-3 months for SSI education and use case definition, 1-2 months for governance framework development if creating new network, 3-6 months for agent and application development using Aries frameworks, 2-4 months for user experience design and wallet selection, 2-4 months for pilot deployment with limited users, and 3-6 months for scaling to production. Organisations joining existing networks and implementing verifier-only applications can deploy in 3-6 months, whilst credential issuers or network operators require longer timelines. Proof-of-concept implementations demonstrating credential issuance and verification can be built in 4-8 weeks using Aries frameworks and test networks.\n\n  - ### Major Implementations\n    - **Sovrin Network**: The [[Sovrin Network]] represents the largest public-permissioned Hyperledger Indy deployment, operating globally with steward organisations across North America, Europe, Asia, and other regions. The network implements four-tier architecture including MainNet for production credentials, StagingNet for pre-production testing, BuilderNet for development, and TestNet for experimentation. Steward organisations include [[IBM]], [[Cisco]], [[Deutsche Telekom]], [[Evernym]], [[ATB Financial]], and numerous universities and non-profits operating validator nodes under Sovrin governance framework. The network processes millions of identity transactions whilst maintaining privacy through zero-knowledge proofs and selective disclosure.\n    - **British Columbia Verifiable Organizations Network**: [[Government of British Columbia]]'s [[VON]] represents the first production government implementation of Hyperledger Indy, revolutionising business credential verification in Canadian province. [[OrgBook BC]] publishes verifiable credentials for over 525,000 active legal entities, with credentials issued automatically when businesses incorporate or renew registrations. The implementation includes [[BC Corporate Registry]], [[BC Online]], and integration with federal government systems. Success demonstrated viability of government-issued verifiable credentials, inspiring similar initiatives in [[Ontario]], [[Alberta]], and federal level. [[BC Wallet]] mobile application enables businesses to receive and present credentials, whilst [[OrgBook]] technology has been deployed in other Canadian provinces and internationally.\n    - **Digital Health Pass Initiatives**: Multiple healthcare organisations and governments deployed Hyperledger Indy-based health credential systems during COVID-19 pandemic, enabling privacy-preserving vaccination status verification. [[Linux Foundation Public Health]] developed COVID-19 credential frameworks, whilst [[Good Health Pass Collaborative]] coordinated interoperability across different implementations. These deployments demonstrated SSI can scale to millions of users whilst preserving privacy, though many jurisdictions subsequently adopted simpler barcode-based solutions trading privacy for implementation simplicity. The implementations proved technical viability of verifiable health credentials and established frameworks for future pandemic response or general health record applications.\n\n  - ### Challenges and Limitations\n    - Technical challenges include cryptographic complexity where Anoncreds implementation requires specialised expertise and careful security analysis. [[Key management]] for individuals presents usability challenges as losing wallet private keys means losing credential access without recovery mechanisms, necessitating balance between security and usability through backup procedures or distributed key recovery. [[Scalability limitations]] exist for ledger writes where validator consensus throughput limits transaction rate, though read operations scale well through caching. [[Revocation privacy]] tradeoffs require balancing timely revocation notification against preventing correlation through revocation registry access patterns. [[Interoperability challenges]] persist across different Indy networks and alternative SSI implementations using different credential formats.\n    - Organisational challenges centre on achieving critical mass adoption where SSI value increases with ecosystem participation but early participants face chicken-and-egg problems. [[User experience complexity]] of wallet management, backup procedures, and credential presentation creates barriers for mainstream adoption, requiring significant interface design investment. [[Governance complexity]] for multi-stakeholder networks involves coordinating competing interests, establishing fair decision-making processes, and maintaining network sustainability without centralised control. [[Regulatory uncertainty]] exists in many jurisdictions where laws assume centralised identity systems and may not accommodate distributed models.\n    - Scalability considerations include ledger size growth over time as schemas, credential definitions, and revocation registries accumulate, though Indy stores only public information keeping state smaller than general-purpose blockchains. [[Agent infrastructure]] costs can become significant for organisations operating agents for many users, requiring efficient hosting and message routing. [[Mobile wallet challenges]] include limited computational resources for zero-knowledge proof generation and battery consumption for background processes maintaining credential status.\n    - Security concerns include compromised credential issuers issuing fraudulent credentials that verifiers cannot distinguish from legitimate ones, requiring governance frameworks and issuer reputation systems. [[Quantum computing threats]] to current cryptographic schemes necessitate migration plans to post-quantum algorithms, with research into quantum-resistant anonymous credentials ongoing. [[Malicious verifiers]] could attempt correlation attacks combining data from multiple credential presentations, requiring user interface warnings and privacy-preserving verification patterns.\n\n  - ### Future Directions\n    - Emerging trends include integration with [[Decentralized Finance]] protocols where verifiable credentials enable KYC compliance whilst preserving privacy, allowing DeFi protocols to satisfy regulatory requirements without collecting personal data. [[Central Bank Digital Currencies]] may leverage SSI for user identification whilst preserving transaction privacy. [[Tokenised assets]] benefit from identity verification without compromising anonymity through selective credential disclosure.\n    - Planned improvements focus on enhanced cryptographic schemes including [[BBS+ Signatures]] enabling more efficient selective disclosure than current Anoncreds implementation, with better privacy properties and performance characteristics. [[AnonCreds v2]] specification addresses technical debt and incorporates improvements from years of production experience. [[DID:Peer]] method eliminates ledger dependency for peer-to-peer relationships, reducing transaction costs and improving privacy. [[Aries Protocol versioning]] ensures backward compatibility whilst enabling protocol evolution.\n    - Research areas include [[Post-quantum anonymous credentials]] resistant to quantum computer attacks, critical for long-term security of identity systems storing credentials for years. [[Distributed key management]] schemes enable credential recovery without centralised services through techniques like [[Shamir Secret Sharing]] or [[Threshold Cryptography]]. [[Reputation systems]] for credential issuers enable verifiers to assess issuer trustworthiness without centralised accreditation. [[Machine learning]] applications include fraud detection identifying unusual credential usage patterns whilst preserving privacy through federated learning or differential privacy. [[Verifiable computation]] enables proving complex predicates about credentials without revealing underlying data. Integration with [[Internet of Things]] enables devices to hold credentials and participate in SSI ecosystems, supporting supply chain traceability and device identity. [[Biometric credentials]] research explores privacy-preserving biometric verification using zero-knowledge proofs where biometric templates remain under individual control.\n\n  - #\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable\n\n\n## References and Further Reading\n    - [[Hyperledger Indy Documentation]] - Comprehensive technical documentation covering ledger, agents, and cryptography\n    - [[W3C Decentralized Identifier Specification]] - Standard for globally unique identifiers on distributed ledgers\n    - [[W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model]] - Standard for digitally signed credentials with cryptographic proofs\n    - [[Sovrin Governance Framework]] - Example governance model for public-permissioned identity networks\n    - [[Self-Sovereign Identity]] by Alex Preukschat and Drummond Reed - Comprehensive book on SSI principles and implementations\n    - [[A Comprehensive Guide to Self-Sovereign Identity]] by Kaliya Young et al. - Practical guide to SSI concepts and deployment\n    - [[BC VON Case Study]] - Government implementation of verifiable organization credentials\n    - [[The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity]] by Christopher Allen - Foundational principles defining SSI\n    - [[Anonymous Credentials Light]] - Technical specification of Anoncreds cryptographic scheme",
