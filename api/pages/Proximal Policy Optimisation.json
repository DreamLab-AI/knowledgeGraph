PPO is the standard RL algorithm used in RLHF for optimising language models based on reward model feedback.\n\n\n## Academic Context\n\n- Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) is a family of policy gradient methods in reinforcement learning (RL), introduced by OpenAI in 2017.\n  - It balances simplicity, stability, and performance, addressing issues of high variance and instability common in earlier policy gradient methods such as REINFORCE.\n  - PPO employs a clipped surrogate objective to constrain policy updates, preventing destabilising large changes without requiring complex second-order derivatives.\n- The algorithm typically uses an actor-critic architecture, combining a policy model (actor) and a value function estimator (critic).\n  - It utilises Generalised Advantage Estimation (GAE) to reduce variance in policy gradient estimates while maintaining low bias.\n- PPO has become a foundational algorithm in RL, particularly for fine-tuning large language models through reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF).\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- PPO remains one of the most widely adopted RL algorithms due to its robustness, ease of implementation, and competitive performance.\n  - It is extensively used in domains ranging from robotics and control tasks to natural language processing and game playing.\n- Recent enhancements, such as PPO+ (Kallel et al., 2025), improve stability and efficiency by incorporating proper action bounds, off-policy critic training, and entropy bonuses, reducing hyperparameter sensitivity.\n- Technical capabilities:\n  - PPO supports multiple epochs of stochastic gradient ascent per policy update, improving data efficiency over Trust Region Policy Optimisation (TRPO).\n  - Limitations include sensitivity to hyperparameters and challenges in complex, high-dimensional environments.\n- Standards and frameworks:\n  - PPO is implemented in major RL libraries such as PyTorch’s TorchRL, OpenAI Baselines, and Stable Baselines3.\n  - It is often integrated into pipelines for training large language models and autonomous agents.\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers and sources:\n  - Schulman, J., Wolski, F., Dhariwal, P., Radford, A., & Klimov, O.
