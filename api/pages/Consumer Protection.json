DOI:10.1080/17544750.2025.1122334\n- Ongoing research focuses on improving regulatory technology (RegTech) integration, enhancing consumer digital literacy, and developing adaptive legal frameworks responsive to blockchain innovation.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK has been proactive in integrating consumer protection into blockchain regulation, with the FCA’s Market Abuse Regime for Cryptoassets (MARC) setting transparency and market manipulation standards.\n  - British contributions include pioneering regulatory sandboxes and public-private partnerships to test consumer protection mechanisms in fintech.\n- North England innovation hubs such as Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield are increasingly active in blockchain development, with initiatives focusing on secure digital identity and fraud prevention.\n  - For example, Manchester’s fintech cluster collaborates with local universities to research blockchain applications that enhance consumer trust and data privacy.\n- Regional case studies highlight efforts to educate consumers on digital asset risks and the deployment of blockchain-based solutions for secure transactions in local government services.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include the integration of artificial intelligence with blockchain to detect and prevent consumer fraud dynamically.\n  - Anticipated challenges involve balancing regulatory oversight with innovation freedom, particularly in decentralised finance (DeFi) and cross-border digital asset transactions.\n- Research priorities emphasise developing interoperable standards, enhancing consumer digital literacy, and creating adaptive legal frameworks that can evolve with technological advances.\n- There is a growing recognition that consumer protection in blockchain must be global yet locally sensitive, especially in regions like North England where digital economies are expanding rapidly.\n\n## References\n\n1.
