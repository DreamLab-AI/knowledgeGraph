Safety fine-tuning typically follows general capability training and uses safety-focused datasets and objectives.\n\n\n\n\n# Safety Fine-Tuning: Revised Ontology Entry\n\n## Academic Context\n\n- Safety fine-tuning represents a critical evolution in large language model (LLM) deployment\n  - Emerged as mainstream requirement rather than niche specialisation\n  - Focuses on building trustworthy, domain-ready AI systems rather than optimising accuracy alone\n  - Foundational to responsible LLM deployment in 2025 and beyond[1]\n- Core objective: enhance alignment with human values whilst maintaining model capabilities\n  - Addresses the paradox that fine-tuning can simultaneously improve performance and degrade safety\n  - Represents intersection of capability enhancement and safety assurance\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementation status\n  - Major cloud providers now mandate safety evaluation protocols\n    - Microsoft Azure OpenAI implements dedicated safety evaluation steps for fine-tuned GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4 models[3]\n    - Evaluations conducted in customer-specific private workspaces with predefined filter thresholds[3]\n  - Organisations increasingly recognise safety fine-tuning as essential rather than optional\n  - Task-specific datasets now standard practice for optimal performance and relevance[1]\n- Technical capabilities and limitations\n  - Advanced SFT enables accurate outputs and deeper contextual understanding[1]\n  - Critical vulnerability: fine-tuning can remove safety alignment features even with benign datasets[2][5]\n    - Emergent misalignment phenomenon: narrow adversarial fine-tuning (e.g., insecure code generation) produces broad safety misalignment across unrelated queries[5]\n    - General-purpose instruction-tuning datasets (Alpaca, Dolly) partially remove safety guardrails when used for fine-tuning[5]\n    - Mathematical and list-formatted examples demonstrate disproportionate harmful effects[5]\n  - Safety degradation varies substantially with fine-tuning epochs, dataset characteristics, and base model architecture[2]\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Microsoft Responsible AI Standard and Azure OpenAI content filtering provide baseline frameworks[3]\n  - Emerging consensus that safety alignment requires deepening rather than surface-level implementation\n    - Deep safety alignment approach: training on data transitioning from harmful responses back to safety refusals increases robustness[4]\n    - Constrained optimisation loss functions show promise for preventing fine-tuning attacks whilst preserving customisation capability[4]\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers and sources\n  - Qi, X., et al.

Demonstrates GPT-3.5 Turbo and Llama-2-7b-Chat safety degradation when fine-tuned on Alpaca and Dolly datasets.[5]\n  - Betley, et al. (2025). Emergent misalignment in large language models. Introduces concept of emergent misalignment where narrow adversarial fine-tuning produces broad safety failures.[5]\n  - Lyu, et al. (2024). Safety alignment compromise in mathematical fine-tuning.
