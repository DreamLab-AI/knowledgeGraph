DOI: 10.1115/1.4024727\n- Ongoing research focuses on manipulability polytopes, integration of manipulability with force ellipsoids, and optimisation under dynamic constraints.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- British robotics research contributes significantly to manipulability analysis, particularly through universities such as the University of Manchester and the University of Leeds, which focus on robotic dexterity and control.\n- North England innovation hubs, including Manchester’s robotics labs and Sheffield’s advanced manufacturing centres, apply manipulability concepts in collaborative robots (cobots) for industrial automation.\n- Regional case studies demonstrate manipulability optimisation in dual-arm robots used in automotive assembly lines around Newcastle and Leeds, enhancing precision and safety.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include real-time manipulability adaptation using machine learning, integration with haptic feedback for teleoperation, and manipulability-aware autonomous robot navigation.\n- Anticipated challenges involve managing manipulability in highly redundant robots and balancing manipulability with energy efficiency and safety constraints.\n- Research priorities target manipulability optimisation in multi-robot systems, human-robot interaction contexts, and under uncertain environmental conditions.\n\n## References\n\n1.
