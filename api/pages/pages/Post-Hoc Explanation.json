(2017). *A Unified Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.\n    - Developed SHAP, a game-theoretic method for feature attribution.\n- Ongoing research focuses on improving explanation fidelity, mitigating biases in explanations, and integrating causal inference to move beyond correlation.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK is a leader in XAI research, with significant contributions from universities and research centres in North England.\n  - The University of Manchester’s AI group explores post hoc interpretability in healthcare diagnostics.\n  - Leeds Institute for Data Analytics collaborates on explainability frameworks for financial services.\n  - Newcastle University investigates post hoc methods in environmental modelling.\n  - Sheffield’s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre applies explainability to industrial AI systems.\n- Regional innovation hubs foster industry-academic partnerships, promoting practical deployment of post hoc explanations in sectors vital to the North, such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing.\n- The Alan Turing Institute, headquartered in London but with strong North England collaborations, supports national efforts to standardise and improve explainability practices.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include:\n  - Integration of causal inference techniques to enhance the explanatory power beyond mere correlations.\n  - Development of standardised benchmarks and empirical validation protocols to assess explanation quality and reliability.\n  - Increased focus on fairness and bias mitigation within explanations to ensure equitable AI outcomes.\n  - Expansion of user-centric explanation methods tailored to diverse stakeholders, from data scientists to regulators and end-users.\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Balancing explanation complexity with user comprehensibility.\n  - Addressing the epistemic limits of post hoc methods while maintaining practical utility.\n  - Navigating regulatory requirements, especially in the UK’s evolving AI governance landscape.\n- Research priorities include:\n  - Formalising theoretical frameworks for explanation validity.\n  - Enhancing robustness of explanations against adversarial manipulation.\n  - Exploring regional and sector-specific needs, particularly in the UK’s North England context.\n\n## References\n\n1.
