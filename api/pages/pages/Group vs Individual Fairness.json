(2012) and subsequent scholarship.\n\n- Industry adoption of fairness-aware ML models is widespread, with organisations integrating fairness metrics into model evaluation pipelines to mitigate bias and ensure compliance with ethical standards.\n  - Common metrics include demographic parity, equalised odds, and predictive rate parity, often computed via confusion matrices to assess performance across sensitive groups.\n- Notable platforms and companies globally have embedded fairness tools, with increasing emphasis on transparency and accountability in AI systems.\n- In the UK, regulatory bodies and AI ethics initiatives promote fairness standards, encouraging organisations to adopt rigorous fairness assessments.\n- Technical limitations persist, notably the trade-offs between group and individual fairness, difficulties in defining similarity metrics, and challenges in balancing fairness with predictive accuracy.\n- Standards such as IEEE 3198-2025 provide formalised methods, metrics, and test cases for fairness evaluation, supporting consistent and replicable assessments.\n\n## Technical Details\n\n- **Id**: 0383-group-vs-individual-fairness-about\n- **Collapsed**: true\n- **Domain Prefix**: AI\n- **Sequence Number**: 0383\n- **Filename History**: [\"AI-0383-group-vs-individual-fairness.md\"]\n- **Public Access**: true\n- **Source Domain**: ai\n- **Status**: in-progress\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-10-29\n- **Maturity**: mature\n- **Source**: [[Dwork et al.
