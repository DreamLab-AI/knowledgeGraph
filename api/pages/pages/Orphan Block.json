DOI: 10.1145/2976749.2978390\n  - These papers analyse orphan blocks’ impact on security, throughput, and consensus finality.\n- Ongoing research explores:\n  - Protocol enhancements to reduce orphan rates without compromising decentralisation.\n  - Alternative consensus mechanisms (e.g., Proof-of-Stake) that inherently minimise orphan block occurrences.\n  - Network topology optimisation to improve block propagation speed.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK hosts several blockchain innovation hubs, including Manchester and Leeds, where research into blockchain scalability and security incorporates orphan block dynamics.\n- Sheffield and Newcastle-based fintech startups integrate orphan block awareness into their blockchain-based financial products to ensure robust transaction processing.\n- British regulatory bodies, such as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), recommend clear communication about transaction finality and orphan block implications to protect consumers.\n- UK academic institutions contribute to blockchain research, focusing on network resilience and consensus mechanisms that address orphan block challenges.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include:\n  - Deployment of advanced block propagation protocols (e.g., Fibre, Compact Blocks) to further reduce orphan rates.\n  - Increased adoption of hybrid consensus models blending PoW and PoS to balance security and efficiency.\n  - Enhanced tooling for real-time orphan block detection and analytics to improve network monitoring.\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Balancing decentralisation with the need for faster consensus and lower orphan rates.\n  - Educating users and developers on orphan block effects to prevent misinterpretation of transaction delays.\n- Research priorities:\n  - Developing consensus algorithms that minimise orphan blocks without centralising control.\n  - Investigating the socio-technical impact of orphan blocks on user trust and network participation.\n\n## References\n\n1.
