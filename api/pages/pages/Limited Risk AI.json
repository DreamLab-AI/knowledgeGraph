This revision clarifies the distinction, incorporates August 2025 transparency rule implementation, and reflects current regulatory status as of November 2025. Proposed amendments remain subject to finalisation.\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-11\n- **Review Status**: Comprehensive editorial review\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
