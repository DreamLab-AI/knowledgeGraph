DOI: 10.1007/s42288-023-00045-9\n- Ongoing research explores:\n  - Enhancing native token scalability and interoperability\n  - Economic incentives for validator participation and decentralisation\n  - Governance models enabled by native tokens\n  - Environmental impacts and sustainable consensus mechanisms\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK has fostered blockchain innovation through regulatory frameworks and research initiatives, with native tokens central to many projects\n- North England cities such as Manchester and Leeds host blockchain hubs focusing on fintech, digital identity, and supply chain solutions utilising native tokens for transaction settlement and governance\n- Sheffield and Newcastle have emerging communities exploring token-based incentives for smart city infrastructure and energy grids\n- British academia contributes to tokenomics and blockchain governance research, with institutions like the University of Manchester and Newcastle University publishing influential work\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include:\n  - Cross-chain native token bridges enhancing liquidity and interoperability\n  - Integration of native tokens with real-world assets via tokenisation, blending digital and physical economies\n  - Expansion of native token roles in decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs) and Web3 governance\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Balancing scalability with security and decentralisation (the blockchain trilemma)\n  - Regulatory clarity, especially regarding token classification and consumer protection in the UK and globally\n  - Environmental sustainability of native token consensus mechanisms\n- Research priorities focus on:\n  - Designing resilient, user-friendly native token economic models\n  - Developing standards for native token interoperability\n  - Exploring socio-economic impacts of native token adoption in regional economies\n\n## References\n\n1.
