The vision emphasises that \"linking up the great cities of the North could achieve far more than the sum of their parts in economic terms\"[3].\n**Investment and Support Infrastructure**\nThe Northern Powerhouse Investment Fund, combining European and domestic funding, has facilitated over £500 million of new investment to support small and medium-sized enterprise growth across the region[1].\n**Projected Economic Impact**\nUnder a transformational scenario, the North could generate 1.5 million new jobs by 2050, with GVA projected to be £97 billion higher than under a \"business as usual\" trajectory[2].\nIf you're seeking information about specific innovation hubs, technology clusters, or particular cities within the Northern Powerhouse, I'd be happy to provide more targeted information with additional search results focused on those areas.\n\n## Technical Details\n\n- **Id**: north-england-innovation-corridor-ontology\n- **Collapsed**: true\n- **Source Domain**: uk-regions\n- **Status**: active\n- **Public Access**: true\n- **Maturity**: established\n- **Region**: Northern Powerhouse\n- **Focus Areas**: Regional Collaboration, Innovation\n- **Owl:Class**: uk:NorthEnglandInnovationCorridor\n- **Owl:Physicality**: ConceptualEntity\n- **Owl:Role**: RegionalEcosystem\n- **Belongstodomain**: [[UKTechEcosystem]]\n\n## Related Hubs\n\n- [[North England Innovation Corridor]]\n- [[Northern Powerhouse]]\n- [[UK Tech Ecosystem]]\n\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable\n\n## References\n\n1.
