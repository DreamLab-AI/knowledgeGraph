Digital Ontology Repositories (DORs) are foundational infrastructures for the storage, versioning, and management of formal ontologies and semantic models, supporting interoperability and shared understanding across domains, including the metaverse, digital twins, and enterprise data ecosystems\n  - The field has matured beyond simple catalogues, now supporting advanced features such as mapping visualisation, metadata filtering, and bulk downloads, with increasing emphasis on standards compliance and community-driven curation\n\n- Key developments and current state\n  - Repositories now routinely support interoperable mappings between ontologies, leveraging standards such as SSSOM (Semantic Similarity and Mapping Ontology Model) for mapping import and storage\n  - There is a growing trend towards open, community-driven repositories that prioritise hosting and serving mappings rather than creating or editing them, reflecting a shift towards collaborative, distributed knowledge management\n\n- Academic foundations\n  - The theoretical underpinnings of DORs draw from knowledge representation, semantic web technologies, and model-based systems engineering, with ontologies serving as the backbone for structured knowledge representation and integration\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Notable organisations and platforms\n    - BioPortal, a leading open community resource, provides extensive support for sharing, searching, and utilising biomedical ontologies, with a strong focus on interoperable mappings and standards compliance\n    - Palantir Ontology offers an operational layer for organisations, connecting digital assets to real-world counterparts and enabling robust semantic and kinetic elements for enterprise workflows\n    - Azure Digital Twins leverages DTDL-based industry ontologies to accelerate development of digital twin solutions, particularly in energy and infrastructure domains\n  - UK and North England examples where relevant\n    - The University of Manchester’s Digital Health Centre has adopted ontology-driven approaches for integrating clinical and research data, supporting cross-domain interoperability in healthcare\n    - Leeds-based digital innovation hubs are exploring ontology repositories for smart city applications, focusing on urban infrastructure and citizen services\n    - Newcastle University’s Institute for Data Science is developing ontology frameworks for environmental monitoring and sustainability, with a particular emphasis on regional data integration\n\n- Technical capabilities and limitations\n  - Modern DORs support advanced features such as version control, metadata filtering, and bulk downloads, but challenges remain in ensuring consistent quality and completeness of mappings\n  - Interoperability is enhanced by standards such as SSSOM, but there is ongoing work to improve mapping visualisation and user experience\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - SSSOM (Semantic Similarity and Mapping Ontology Model) is widely adopted for mapping import and storage, ensuring compliance and interoperability across repositories\n  - Other relevant standards include OWL (Web Ontology Language) and RDF (Resource Description Framework), which underpin the formal representation of ontologies\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers and sources\n  -
