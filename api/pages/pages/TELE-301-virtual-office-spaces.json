Unlike temporary meeting rooms, these spaces persist across sessions: whiteboards retain content, desks have assigned avatars, and team members \"walk\" through virtual hallways to join spontaneous conversations.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Persistent Configuration**: Office layout, furniture, decorations remain between sessions\n- **Hot-Desking**: Team members claim virtual desks, personalise avatars\n- **Spatial Audio**: Conversations audible based on avatar proximity (realistic office acoustics)\n- **Shared Artefacts**: Whiteboards [[TELE-302-shared-whiteboards]], 3D models, documents persist\n- **Meeting Rooms**: Dedicated conference spaces for scheduled/impromptu meetings\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- **Hybrid Work**: Remote employees \"attend\" virtual office daily\n- **Global Teams**: Timezone-distributed teams overlap in virtual office hours\n- **Onboarding**: New hires tour virtual HQ, meet colleagues as avatars\n- **Social Interaction**: Watercooler conversations, casual cheque-ins\n\n## Examples\n\n- **PwC UK**: 1,200-person virtual office in Horizon Workrooms\n- **Accenture**: \"Nth Floor\" metaverse office (100,000+ employees)\n- **Spatial**: Creator-focused virtual workspaces with NFT galleries\n\n## Related Concepts\n\n- [[TELE-002-telecollaboration]]\n- [[TELE-020-virtual-reality-telepresence]]\n- [[TELE-028-horizon-workrooms]]\n- [[TELE-300-digital-twin-collaboration]]\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Term-ID**: TELE-301\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Maturity**: Developing\n- **Authority Score**: 0.81",
