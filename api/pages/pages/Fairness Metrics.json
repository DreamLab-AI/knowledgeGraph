These metrics provide objective, measurable criteria to assess whether an algorithmic system produces disparate impacts, maintains statistical parity, or achieves equalized odds across protected attributes such as race, gender, age, or disability status. Key fairness metrics include demographic parity (equal positive prediction rates across groups), equalized odds (equal true positive and false positive rates), equal opportunity (equal true positive rates), and predictive parity (equal precision across groups). The selection and application of fairness metrics depends on the specific context, stakeholder values, and regulatory requirements, as different metrics can conflict and no single metric satisfies all fairness criteria simultaneously. Implementation requires confusion matrix analysis, statistical testing, and careful consideration of base rate differences between groups, as formalized in IEEE P7003-2021 and NIST SP 1270 guidelines for algorithmic fairness assessment.\n\t- source:: [[IEEE P7003-2021]], [[ISO/IEC TR 24027]], [[NIST SP 1270]]\n\t- maturity:: mature\n\t- #### Relationships\n\t  id:: fairness-metrics-relationships\n\t  collapsed:: true\n\t\t- is-part-of:: [[Algorithmic Fairness]]\n\t\t- is-part-of:: [[Bias Detection]]\n\t\t- is-part-of:: [[AI Ethics]]\n\t\t- requires:: [[Protected Attributes]]\n\t\t- requires:: [[Statistical Testing]]\n\t\t- requires:: [[Confusion Matrix]]\n\t\t- enables:: [[Regulatory Compliance]]\n\t\t- enables:: [[Bias Mitigation]]\n\t\t- enables:: [[Fairness Auditing]]\n\t\t- related-to:: [[Value Alignment]]\n\t\t- related-to:: [[Algorithmic Accountability]]\n\t\t- related-to:: [[AI Trustworthiness]]\n\t\t- related-to:: [[AI Safety Research]]\n\t\t- depends-on:: [[NIST SP 1270]]\n\t\t- depends-on:: [[IEEE P7003-2021]]\n\t\t- depends-on:: [[ISO/IEC TR 24027]]\n\t\t- measured-by:: [[Fairness Auditing Tools]]\n\n## Current Landscape (2024-2025)\n\n- ### Industry Adoption and Implementations\n  - Many organisations now embed fairness metrics into their AI governance strategies, using them to comply with regulations, build trust, and protect brand reputation\n  - Notable platforms include Iterate.ai, Shelf.io, and IEEE's machine learning fairness standards\n  - **Technical Capabilities**:\n    - Fairness metrics can identify and quantify bias across groups, but they cannot eliminate all forms of unfairness due to inherent trade-offs between different fairness definitions\n    - Metrics are most effective when combined with transparency, explainability, and continuous monitoring\n  - **Standards and Frameworks**:\n    - [[IEEE 3198-2025]]: Comprehensive standard for evaluating machine learning fairness, specifying methods, metrics, and test cases\n    - [[EU AI Act]]: European regulatory framework for AI systems\n    - [[UK AI Regulation]]: Regulatory guidance on automated decision-making\n\n- ### UK Context\n  - The [[UK AI Regulation]] emphasises fairness assessment through the [[ICO AI Auditing Framework]] and [[BSI ADS standards]]. UK organisations implementing fairness metrics include:\n    - **[[NHS AI Lab]]**: Fairness testing for medical diagnosis algorithms\n    - **[[Financial Conduct Authority]]**: Credit decisioning fairness requirements\n    - **[[University of Oxford]]**: Research on fairness metric selection and tradeoffs\n    - **Manchester AI Ethics Hub**: Regional fairness auditing initiatives\n\n  - **North England Regional Context**:\n    - UK-based companies and public sector bodies increasingly adopt fairness metrics, particularly in sectors such as finance, healthcare, and public services\n    - In North England, cities like Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield host innovation hubs and research centres focused on ethical AI, including fairness and bias mitigation\n\n- ### 2024-2025 Developments\n  - Integration with [[Large Language Models]] fairness testing\n  - [[Intersectional Fairness]] metrics accounting for multiple protected attributes\n  - [[Causal Fairness]] frameworks using causal inference\n  - [[Dynamic Fairness]] metrics for evolving populations\n  - [[Differential Privacy]] integration for fairness with privacy guarantees\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers and sources\n  - Barocas, S., Hardt, M., & Narayanan, A.
