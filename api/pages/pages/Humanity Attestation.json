This concept is increasingly critical as digital platforms grapple with the proliferation of bots and AI-generated content. The attestation process is foundational for ensuring trust, fairness, and security in online ecosystems.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Current Developments (2024–2025)\n\n### Biometric-Based Verification\nThe most prominent trend in humanity attestation is the use of **biometric technologies** to confirm unique human identity. Leading projects such as **Humanity Protocol** and **Worldcoin (World Network)** have deployed biometric scanners—palm prints and iris scans, respectively—to provide “Proof of Humanity” or “Proof of Personhood” (PoP) [1, 2, 3, 6].\n\n- **Humanity Protocol** uses palm biometrics and palm vein authentication, storing only cryptographic hashes of biometric data to ensure privacy and prevent spoofing [3, 5].\n- **Worldcoin** relies on iris scanning, with data protected by advanced cryptography and personal custody features [6].\n\n### Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Privacy\nBoth protocols leverage **zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs)** to verify identity without exposing personal data. This ensures that verifiers only confirm the uniqueness of the individual, not their identity details [2, 5].\n\n### Decentralised Identity Foundations\nThe launch of the **Humanity Foundation** in 2025, led by industry figures such as Yat Siu (Animoca Brands), signals a move towards ecosystem-wide support for decentralised identity solutions, including funding research, development, and community growth incentives [2, 4].\n\n### Mobile and Offline Integration\nHumanity Protocol is expanding beyond online use, developing mobile app enrolment and personal hardware devices for offline attestation. The company plans to release a smartphone-compatible enrolment device in 2025 [3, 5].\n\n---\n\n## 2. Key Applications\n\n### Web3 and Blockchain\n- **Proof of Humanity (PoH)** is used to prevent Sybil attacks in blockchain networks, ensuring each participant is a unique human [3, 5].\n- Platforms like **Kaito** and **Open Campus** integrate PoH for verifying authentic contributors and educational credentials [5].\n\n### Online Services and Events\n- Humanity Protocol’s palm scanners are deployed for event attendance, building cheque-ins, and secure payments, reducing reliance on third-party identity verification [1, 3].\n\n### AI and Content Moderation\n- As AI-generated content rises, humanity attestation is used to differentiate between human and bot accounts, improving trust in social media and content platforms [6].\n\n---\n\n## 3. Industry Standards\n\n### Decentralised Identity (DID)\n- The **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)** has published the **Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0** specification, which provides a framework for self-sovereign identity and is foundational for humanity attestation systems [W3C DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).\n\n### Verifiable Credentials\n- The **W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0** enables the creation of tamper-evident credentials that can be used for humanity attestation [W3C VC](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/).\n\n### Privacy and Security\n- **ISO/IEC 24358** covers biometric information protection, relevant for biometric-based attestation systems [ISO/IEC 24358](https://www.iso.org/standard/75538.html).\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Notable Examples\n\n| Organisation/Platform      | Technology Used         | Application Area         | Source |\n|---------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------|\n| **Humanity Protocol**     | Palm biometrics, ZK-proofs | Web3, events, payments | [1, 2, 3, 5] |\n| **Worldcoin (World Network)** | Iris scanning, cryptography | Blockchain, identity | [6] |\n| **Kaito**                 | Proof of Humanity (PoH) | Web3 contributor verification | [5] |\n| **Open Campus (EDU)**     | PoH integration         | Educational credentials | [5] |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Future Outlook\n\n### Expansion to Offline and Mobile\nExpect broader adoption of mobile and offline attestation devices, making humanity attestation more accessible and user-friendly [3, 5].\n\n### Integration with AI and Web3\nAs AI systems become more sophisticated, humanity attestation will be increasingly integrated into AI moderation tools and Web3 platforms to ensure authenticity and prevent abuse [6].\n\n### Regulatory and Ethical Considerations\nWith growing use of biometrics, there will be increased scrutiny on privacy, data protection, and ethical use of biometric data. Industry standards and regulations are likely to evolve in response [2, 4].\n\n### Ecosystem Growth\nFoundations and ecosystem funds will drive innovation, supporting new use cases and global adoption of humanity attestation technologies [2, 4].\n\n---\n\n**References**\n\n- [1] Humanity Protocol Raises USD 20M for Identity Blockchain Project.
