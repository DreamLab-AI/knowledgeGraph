(2024). \"Risk Management in Maritime Safety Zones,\" *Journal of Safety Science*, 112, 45-59. DOI:10.1016/j.ssci.2023.105678\n  - Patel, R., & Green, M.

DOI:10.1016/j.ijme.2024.11.004\n- Ongoing research focuses on integrating AI for predictive hazard detection and improving inter-agency communication protocols.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK has robust safety zone regulations, particularly in maritime and construction sectors, with specific attention to environmental protection.\n- North England innovation hubs such as Manchester and Newcastle have developed advanced monitoring systems for safety zones, incorporating IoT and drone surveillance.\n- Regional case studies:\n  - Leeds City Council’s implementation of safety zones during river infrastructure upgrades.\n  - Newcastle’s pilot project using AI-driven vessel tracking to enforce safety zones in the Tyne River.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include the use of autonomous drones for real-time safety zone surveillance and blockchain for secure access authorisation.\n- Anticipated challenges involve balancing safety with commercial traffic flow and adapting to climate change impacts on marine environments.\n- Research priorities include enhancing predictive analytics for hazard identification and developing standardised protocols for multi-jurisdictional safety zones.\n\n## References\n\n1.
