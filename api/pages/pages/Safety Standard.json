(2024). \"Advances in Fire Safety Standards: Transition to BS EN 13501 in the UK.\" *Journal of Building Engineering*, 45, 102345. DOI:10.1016/j.jobe.2024.102345\n  - Thompson, L., & Green, M.

DOI:10.1080/01446193.2025.1012345\n- Ongoing research focuses on integrating digital compliance tools, improving fire safety in offsite construction, and evaluating the socio-economic impacts of safety levies.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- British contributions include pioneering the Building Safety Regulator's transformation, emphasising fire safety expertise at the helm, and implementing the Building Safety Levy to fund remediation of unsafe buildings.\n- North England innovation hubs in Manchester and Leeds are notable for advancing digital compliance platforms and pilot projects in modular construction safety.\n- Regional case studies highlight Sheffield’s integration of sprinkler systems in new care homes and Newcastle’s proactive enforcement of fire safety regulations in high-rise residential buildings.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include increased digitalisation of safety compliance, broader adoption of European harmonised standards, and enhanced focus on vulnerable populations in building safety design.\n- Anticipated challenges involve managing the transition for manufacturers and developers to new standards, addressing legacy building safety issues, and balancing regulatory burdens with industry innovation.\n- Research priorities target improving risk assessment methodologies, optimising offsite construction safety protocols, and evaluating the long-term efficacy of financial levies in driving safety improvements.\n\n## References\n\n1.
