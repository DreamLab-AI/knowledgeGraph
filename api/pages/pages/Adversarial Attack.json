(2013) introduced the concept of adversarial examples, demonstrating that small perturbations could fool deep neural networks\n  - Subsequent research has explored various attack and defense strategies, leading to a rich body of literature on adversarial machine learning\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Adversarial attacks are now a significant concern for industries relying on AI, including finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity\n  - Notable organisations and platforms\n    - Financial institutions use adversarial techniques to test and improve fraud detection systems\n    - Healthcare providers are increasingly aware of the risks of manipulated medical images leading to misdiagnosis\n    - Cybersecurity firms develop tools to detect and mitigate adversarial attacks on AI-powered defenses\n\n- UK and North England examples where relevant\n  - Manchester-based companies are at the forefront of developing AI security solutions, with several startups focusing on adversarial machine learning\n  - Leeds and Newcastle have seen a rise in academic-industry collaborations, with universities partnering with local businesses to enhance AI security\n  - Sheffield's Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) is exploring the use of adversarial techniques to improve the robustness of AI in manufacturing processes\n\n- Technical capabilities and limitations\n  - Adversarial attacks can be highly sophisticated, using techniques such as gradient-based optimization to craft inputs that fool models\n  - However, these attacks are not always foolproof; robust models and defensive strategies can mitigate many of the risks\n  - The main limitations include the need for detailed knowledge of the target model and the computational resources required to generate effective adversarial examples\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has published a taxonomy of adversarial machine learning, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding and addressing these threats\n  - Industry standards and best practices are evolving, with a focus on transparency, accountability, and resilience\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers and sources\n  - Szegedy, C., Zaremba, W., Sutskever, I., Bruna, J., Erhan, D., Goodfellow, I., & Fergus, R.
