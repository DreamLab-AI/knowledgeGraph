It is designed for complex, multi-step tasks and can generate high-quality text and code.\n\t- ### Claude 3 Opus\n\t\t- A powerful model that is well-suited for a wide range of tasks.\n\t- ### Claude 3 Haiku\n\t\t- A smaller, faster model that is ideal for real-time applications.\n- ## Features\n\t- **Large context window:** Claude models have a large context window, which allows them to process and understand long documents and conversations.\n\t- **Multilingual:** Claude models can understand and generate text in multiple languages.\n\t- **Code generation:** Claude models can generate code in a variety of programming languages.\n\t- **Safety:** Claude models are designed to be safe and avoid generating harmful or offensive content.\n- ## Resources\n\t- ### Official Website\n\t\t- [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)\n\t- ### Documentation\n\t\t- [Claude Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs)\n\t- ### Prompt Library\n\t\t- [Claude Prompt Library](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/prompt-library)\n\t- ### Model Card\n\t\t- [Claude 3 Model Card](https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/de8ba9b01c9ab7cbabf5c33b80b7bbc618857627/Model_Card_Claude_3.pdf)\n- ## Examples\n\t- [Mancala web app coded in 25 seconds](https://x.com/alliekmiller/status/1803818951706579307)\n\t- [Mario clone made with geometric shapes](https://x.com/skirano/status/1803809495811858807)\n- ## See Also\n\t- [[Large language models]]\n\t- [[OpenAI]]\n\t- [[Google]]\n\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
