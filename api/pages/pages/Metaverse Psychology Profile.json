(2021) and subsequent researchers have developed MetaOntology frameworks specifying state-of-the-art metaverse technologies through systematic domain analysis[1]\n  - Ontological approaches distinguish between virtual entities, their physical instantiation, and functional roles within metaverse systems[1]\n\n- Immersive experience theory\n  - Flanagin, DeAndrea & Holbert (2017, 2020) and Huskey et al. (2020) have advanced mechanism-oriented approaches to understanding immersion across varying technological contexts[3]\n  - Marr's tri-level framework (computational, algorithmic, implementational) provides a structured approach to decomposing immersive psychological processes[3]\n  - Three key processes identified as central to immersive experience: interactivity, boundary alteration, and motivation[7]\n\n- Social ontology considerations\n  - Carrigan (2022) raises critical questions regarding relational goods and trust-building within virtual environments, questioning whether immersive remote connection can sustain genuine intimacy[5]\n  - The distinction between \"IRL fetish\" (preference for physical reality) and reflective preference for digital experiences remains philosophically contested[5]\n\n- Metaverse definition and conceptualisation\n  - Park and Kim define the metaverse primarily as a place, space, or world, emphasising its physical dimension[4]\n  - Mulla Sadra's ontological framework characterises the metaverse as a \"hybrid external credit\" world comprising both tangible and perceptible components with real, objective existence[2]\n\n## UK Context\n\n- British academic contributions\n  - UK-based research institutions have contributed to immersion theory development and ontological frameworks for virtual environments\n  - The Open University and other UK universities have engaged with metaverse psychology research, though specific North England innovation hubs remain limited in published output\n\n- Regulatory and ethical landscape\n  - UK data protection frameworks (GDPR, Data Protection Act 2018) create specific constraints on psychological profiling and behavioural tracking within metaverse platforms\n  - The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has begun issuing guidance on virtual environment data collection, though comprehensive metaverse-specific regulations remain under development\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging research priorities\n  - Developing context-robust theoretical models that remain valid across diverse metaverse platforms and technological implementations\n  - Establishing standardised psychological profiling methodologies that balance personalisation benefits against privacy and autonomy concerns\n  - Understanding boundary alteration mechanisms—how users psychologically transition between immersive and non-immersive states—remains critically under-researched\n\n- Anticipated challenges\n  - Reconciling commercial personalisation interests with ethical data governance and informed consent requirements\n  - Determining whether relational goods (trust, intimacy, genuine social connection) can authentically emerge within virtual environments\n  - Addressing the philosophical tension between virtual and physical reality experiences, particularly post-pandemic shifts in user preferences\n\n- Regulatory and governance development\n  - Harmonisation of psychological profiling standards across jurisdictions, particularly between UK/EU frameworks and international platforms\n  - Establishment of minimum ethical standards for affective response monitoring and sentiment analysis within metaverse systems\n  - Development of user agency mechanisms enabling individuals to understand, contest, and modify their psychological profiles\n\n## References\n\n1.
