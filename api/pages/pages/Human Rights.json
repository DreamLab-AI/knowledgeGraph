[[legal privilege]]\n- **Algorithmic bias** in flight risk, recidivism, and discretionary decisions\n- **\"Human-AI fairness gap\"**: Public perception that human adjudication fairer than algorithmic\n**Key Principle**: \"Machines cannot fully replace key actors in court\"\n- Judges assess sincerity through human cues: shaking hands, voice inflection, eye contact\n- Appellate decisions involve fact-specific grey areas requiring human judgment\n- AI based on existing information cannot make novel legal determinations\n**Citation**: Roberts, J., *2023 Year-End Report on the Federal
