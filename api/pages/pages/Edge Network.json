Consider expanding it to: \"Distributed computing architecture that provisions processing, storage, and networking resources at network periphery, proximate to data sources and end-users, to minimise latency, optimise bandwidth utilisation, and enable real-time decision-making whilst complementing centralised cloud infrastructure.\" This acknowledges edge's complementary rather than replacement role—a distinction worth preserving for technical precision.\n\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-11\n- **Review Status**: Comprehensive editorial review\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
