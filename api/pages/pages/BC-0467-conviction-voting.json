Unlike snapshot-based voting mechanisms where decisions are made at discrete moments, conviction voting allows continuous participation where voting power accumulates gradually the longer tokens remain staked on a proposal. This time-weighted approach addresses critical flaws in traditional governance: it eliminates the need for arbitrary quorum requirements that often lead to voter apathy, prevents last-minute swing votes that create governance instability, and enables minority stakeholders with strong long-term convictions to influence outcomes despite lacking majority token holdings. The mechanism was pioneered by the [[Commons Stack]] and [[1Hive]] community, drawing inspiration from natural consensus-building processes where sustained attention and commitment signal genuine preference intensity more reliably than one-time votes.\n\t-\n\t- The mathematical foundation rests on an exponential decay function where conviction grows asymptotically towards a maximum value as long as tokens remain staked, but decays rapidly when withdrawn. This creates organic prioritisation—proposals that consistently maintain support will eventually pass, whilst those that lose backing quickly fail. The system has been successfully deployed by 1Hive for managing their $20 million+ treasury, where over 150 proposals have been funded through conviction voting since 2020, and by Gardens, a framework enabling dozens of communities to launch customised conviction-based DAOs. Unlike [[BC-0466-quadratic-voting]] which requires discrete voice credit allocation, or [[BC-0462-on-chain-voting]] which concentrates power in whales, conviction voting rewards patience and sustained commitment. However, it also faces challenges including the inability to express negative preferences (opposition), vulnerability to patient capital dominance where wealthy actors can simply outwait smaller stakeholders, and complexity in parameter tuning where the conviction growth rate and spending limits dramatically affect governance outcomes. The mechanism has become particularly prominent in funding continuous public goods and community treasuries within [[BC-0461-decentralized-autonomous-organization]] ecosystems.\n\t-\n\t- ### Mathematical Foundation\n\t  collapsed:: true\n\t\t- Conviction voting's core mechanism uses an exponential accumulation function where conviction C(t) for a proposal at time t is calculated based on staked tokens s and a decay parameter α:\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Conviction Growth**: `C(t) = s × (1 - α^t)`\n\t\t-\n\t\t- Where:\n\t\t- - `s` = tokens staked on the proposal\n\t\t- - `α` = decay/conviction parameter (typically 0.9-0.99)\n\t\t- - `t` = time periods elapsed (usually measured in blocks or days)\n\t\t-\n\t\t- This formula creates an exponential growth curve that asymptotically approaches the maximum conviction value of s. The choice of α determines how quickly conviction accumulates. With α = 0.9, it takes approximately 10 time periods to reach 65% of maximum conviction, whilst α = 0.99 requires 100 periods for the same level.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Conviction Decay**: When tokens are withdrawn, conviction decays symmetrically:\n\t\t-\n\t\t- `C(t) = C_prev × α^(t-t_withdrawal)`\n\t\t-\n\t\t- This creates a powerful incentive to maintain stakes—switching between proposals incurs a conviction penalty as accumulated conviction is lost and must rebuild from zero.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Threshold Function**: A proposal passes when conviction exceeds a dynamic threshold T that depends on the funds requested r and total available funds F:\n\t\t-\n\t\t- `T(r) = (r / F) × β`\n\t\t-\n\t\t- Where β is a calibration parameter controlling spending aggressiveness. Higher β means proposals need more conviction to pass, slowing fund distribution. The threshold grows with requested percentage of treasury, preventing single proposals from draining resources.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Spending Limit**: Most implementations include a maximum spending limit per time period to prevent fund depletion:\n\t\t-\n\t\t- `Σ(approved_proposals_in_period) ≤ F × γ`\n\t\t-\n\t\t- Where γ is the spending rate (e.g., 10% per month). This ensures treasury sustainability.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Game Theory Properties**: Conviction voting is not incentive-compatible in the traditional mechanism design sense—rational actors with patience can game the system by staking early and waiting out others. However, it achieves \"practical stability\" in real communities where participants have finite patience and diverse time preferences. The mechanism trades off game-theoretic robustness for intuitive participation and continuous operation.\n\t\t-\n\t- ### Technical Implementation\n\t  collapsed:: true\n\t\t- Conviction voting implementations must handle continuous state updates efficiently, as conviction scores change every block for all active proposals. The computational challenge is significant: with n active proposals and m stakers, calculating convictions requires n×m operations per block.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **State Management Architecture**:\n\t\t- ```solidity\n\t\t- struct Proposal {\n\t\t-     uint256 requestedAmount;\n\t\t-     address beneficiary;\n\t\t-     uint256 convictionLast;\n\t\t-     uint256 blockLast;\n\t\t-     uint256 totalStaked;\n\t\t-     mapping(address => uint256) stakes;\n\t\t- }\n\t\t-\n\t\t- struct StakeHistory {\n\t\t-     uint256 amount;\n\t\t-     uint256 blockNumber;\n\t\t-     uint256 proposalId;\n\t\t- }\n\t\t-\n\t\t- function calculateConviction(\n\t\t-     uint256 proposalId,\n\t\t-     uint256 currentBlock\n\t\t- ) public view returns (uint256) {\n\t\t-     Proposal storage prop = proposals[proposalId];\n\t\t-     uint256 blocksPassed = currentBlock - prop.blockLast;\n\t\t-\n\t\t-     // Decay previous conviction\n\t\t-     uint256 decayed = prop.convictionLast * pow(ALPHA, blocksPassed) / PRECISION;\n\t\t-\n\t\t-     // Add new conviction from staked tokens\n\t\t-     uint256 newConviction = prop.totalStaked * (1 - pow(ALPHA, blocksPassed)) / PRECISION;\n\t\t-\n\t\t-     return decayed + newConviction;\n\t\t- }\n\t\t- ```\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Efficient Conviction Calculation**: Computing exponentials on-chain is gas-intensive. Implementations use lookup tables for common α values or polynomial approximations. The [[Gardens]] framework uses:\n\t\t-\n\t\t- ```solidity\n\t\t- // Pre-computed alpha^n for common decay rates\n\t\t- uint256[100] private ALPHA_POWERS = [\n\t\t-     1e18, 990000000000000000, 980100000000000000, ...\n\t\t- ];\n\t\t- ```\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Lazy Evaluation**: Rather than updating all proposals every block, conviction is calculated on-demand when users interact:\n\t\t-\n\t\t- ```solidity\n\t\t- function stakeToProposal(uint256 proposalId, uint256 amount) external {\n\t\t-     // Update proposal conviction to current block before modifying stake\n\t\t-     _updateProposalConviction(proposalId);\n\t\t-\n\t\t-     // Update user's stake\n\t\t-     proposals[proposalId].stakes[msg.sender] += amount;\n\t\t-     proposals[proposalId].totalStaked += amount;\n\t\t-\n\t\t-     // Record this block as last update\n\t\t-     proposals[proposalId].blockLast = block.number;\n\t\t- }\n\t\t- ```\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Threshold Calculation**: The dynamic threshold prevents treasury drainage:\n\t\t-\n\t\t- ```python\n\t\t- def calculate_threshold(requested_amount, total_funds, spending_limit):\n\t\t-     ratio = requested_amount / total_funds\n\t\t-     base_threshold = ratio * BETA_PARAMETER\n\t\t-\n\t\t-     # Ensure spending limit isn't violated\n\t\t-     current_period_spent = get_period_spending()\n\t\t-     if current_period_spent + requested_amount > total_funds * SPENDING_LIMIT:\n\t\t-         return INFINITY  # Proposal cannot pass this period\n\t\t-\n\t\t-     return base_threshold\n\t\t- ```\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Automation and Keepers**: Conviction voting requires external actors to execute proposals once thresholds are met. [[1Hive]] uses Celeste (their implementation of Aragon Court) for permissionless proposal execution:\n\t\t-\n\t\t- ```solidity\n\t\t- function executeProposal(uint256 proposalId) external {\n\t\t-     uint256 conviction = calculateConviction(proposalId, block.number);\n\t\t-     uint256 threshold = calculateThreshold(proposals[proposalId].requestedAmount);\n\t\t-\n\t\t-     require(conviction >= threshold, \"Insufficient conviction\");\n\t\t-     require(!proposals[proposalId].executed, \"Already executed\");\n\t\t-\n\t\t-     // Transfer funds to beneficiary\n\t\t-     token.transfer(proposals[proposalId].beneficiary, proposals[proposalId].requestedAmount);\n\t\t-     proposals[proposalId].executed = true;\n\t\t- }\n\t\t- ```\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Parameter Configuration**: Production systems make conviction parameters adjustable by governance:\n\t\t- - **Alpha (α)**: Decay rate, typically 0.9-0.99 (shorter for fast-moving communities)\n\t\t- - **Beta (β)**: Threshold multiplier, typically 0.1-0.5 (higher = more conservative)\n\t\t- - **Spending limit (γ)**: Maximum % of funds per period, typically 5-20%\n\t\t- - **Min threshold**: Absolute minimum conviction to prevent spam, regardless of amount requested\n\t\t-\n\t- ### Real-World Implementations\n\t  collapsed:: true\n\t\t- **1Hive and the Honey Token (2020-present)**:\n\t\t- 1Hive pioneered conviction voting at scale, managing a treasury that peaked at over $20 million in total value. Their system has processed 150+ proposals since launch, distributing funds to community projects ranging from $500 to $100,000. The mechanism operates continuously—no discrete voting periods—with proposals passing organically as they accumulate support. In 2021, a proposal to fund a \"Buzz\" marketing campaign received steady support from 47 community members over six weeks before crossing the conviction threshold and executing automatically. The system revealed preference patterns invisible in snapshot voting: proposals with broad but shallow support (many small stakes) competed against those with narrow but deep support (few large stakes), with the time dimension creating a natural prioritisation mechanism. However, 1Hive has faced challenges with parameter tuning. In mid-2022, the conviction growth rate was too slow (α = 0.997), causing even universally-supported proposals to take months to pass. After community debate, α was adjusted to 0.99, reducing passage time to 2-4 weeks for highly-supported initiatives.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Gardens Framework by 1Hive (2021-present)**:\n\t\t- Building on their conviction voting experience, 1Hive released Gardens, a template for launching customised conviction-based DAOs. Over 30 communities have deployed Gardens instances, including developer collectives, creative guilds, and local community currencies. The framework bundles conviction voting with Celeste dispute resolution, allowing communities to challenge potentially fraudulent proposals. Notable implementations include:\n\t\t- - **Token Engineering Commons (TEC)**: Managing a $6 million treasury with 200+ token holders, funding token engineering research and tools\n\t\t- - **Giveth**: Using conviction voting for their \"GIVgarden\" grants programme, distributing 2 million GIV tokens across 40+ projects in 2022\n\t\t- - **ShapeShift DAO**: Experimenting with hybrid governance combining conviction voting for grants with token-weighted voting for protocol changes\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Commons Stack Funding Pools (2019-present)**:\n\t\t- The Commons Stack, co-founded by Griff Green, developed the theoretical foundations and early implementations of conviction voting. Their \"Trusted Seed\" mechanism uses conviction voting for continuous funding allocation within regenerative economy projects. The Trusted Seed for the TEC raised $750,000 in 2020, with conviction voting governing how these funds supported early development. The system successfully funded 12 core contributors and 8 major initiatives over 18 months. However, participation was concentrated—only 15-20% of token holders actively staked, with 5 major holders accounting for 60% of conviction power, highlighting wealth concentration challenges.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Agave Finance (Gnosis Chain DeFi, 2022-present)**:\n\t\t- Agave, a DeFi lending protocol on Gnosis Chain, uses conviction voting to allocate developer bounties and security audit funding. Their implementation combines conviction voting with role-based permissions—only verified developers can receive funds, whilst all token holders can stake for conviction. In 2023, they funded security audits totalling $180,000 through conviction voting, with decisions taking 3-5 weeks to reach threshold. The system prevents sudden fund movements that could signal insider information in DeFi contexts.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Panvala (Ethereum Public Goods, 2019-2021)**:\n\t\t- Panvala used a variant of conviction voting called \"batch conviction voting\" where conviction accumulated over quarterly epochs, then the highest-conviction proposals received funding proportionally. They distributed $1.4 million to Ethereum infrastructure projects including EthHub, Dappnode, and Tornado Cash development. The system was later deprecated in favour of Gitcoin Grants due to low participation (average 30-40 voters per round) and difficulty explaining the mechanism to new participants.\n\t\t-\n\t- ### Advantages and Benefits\n\t  collapsed:: true\n\t\t- **No Quorum Requirements**: Traditional governance often fails when quorum isn't met, creating deadlock. Conviction voting eliminates this—proposals pass when they accumulate sufficient support, regardless of total turnout. This reduces pressure on governance participation whilst still ensuring well-supported proposals succeed.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Continuous Operation**: Unlike periodic voting rounds, conviction voting operates 24/7. Communities can submit proposals anytime and see them funded as soon as they gain traction, eliminating artificial delays and coordination costs of synchronising voting periods.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Preference Intensity Signalling**: The time dimension reveals commitment depth. A stakeholder willing to lock tokens for months demonstrates stronger conviction than one voting in a 3-day window. This surface information about actual priorities rather than ephemeral opinions.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Reduced Last-Minute Manipulation**: In snapshot voting, whales can observe vote tallies and swing outcomes at the final moment. Conviction voting's continuous nature and decay mechanics make such manipulation expensive—an attacker must maintain stakes for extended periods, during which the community can observe and respond.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Natural Prioritisation**: When multiple proposals compete, community attention naturally flows to highest priorities. Lower-priority initiatives must wait, creating organic queue management without explicit ranking mechanisms.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Sybil Resistance**: Unlike [[BC-0466-quadratic-voting]], conviction voting doesn't benefit from identity splitting. Multiple accounts each staking tokens accumulate the same total conviction as a single account with combined stakes. This eliminates a major attack vector.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Treasury Sustainability**: The dynamic threshold function prevents single proposals from draining reserves. Requesting 50% of funds requires dramatically more conviction than requesting 5%, naturally pacing expenditures.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Empirical Community Satisfaction**: 1Hive surveys show 73% of active participants prefer conviction voting to previous snapshot-based systems, citing reduced \"voting fatigue\" and better alignment with long-term community health.\n\t\t-\n\t- ### Limitations and Challenges\n\t  collapsed:: true\n\t\t- **Inability to Express Opposition**: Conviction voting only supports positive stakes—you can support proposals but cannot actively oppose them. This creates asymmetry where controversial proposals with 60% support and 40% opposition are indistinguishable from those with 60% support and 40% apathy. Communities must rely on social coordination or separate dispute mechanisms (like Celeste) to handle opposition.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Patient Capital Dominance**: Wealthy stakeholders who can afford to lock tokens indefinitely gain disproportionate power. A whale staking 10,000 tokens for six months will eventually overcome 1,000 community members staking 20 tokens for two weeks, even if the latter represents broader consensus. This creates plutocratic tendencies different from but not eliminated compared to token-weighted voting.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Parameter Sensitivity**: Conviction voting outcomes are extremely sensitive to α, β, and γ parameters. 1Hive's experience showed that α = 0.997 vs α = 0.99 meant the difference between 8-week and 2-week proposal timelines. Communities often struggle to tune parameters, and changes require their own governance process, creating recursive complexity.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Cognitive Complexity**: Understanding exponential conviction growth is non-intuitive. Users frequently ask \"when will this proposal pass?\" and there's no simple answer—it depends on future staking behaviour. This opacity reduces participation, with many preferring simpler snapshot voting.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Low Participation Rates**: Despite eliminating quorum requirements, conviction voting often sees lower participation than snapshot voting. In TEC, only 15-20% of token holders actively stake, compared to 25-30% typical snapshot participation. The continuous commitment requirement may exceed casual participants' engagement levels.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Frontrunning and Strategic Unstaking**: Sophisticated actors can watch conviction curves and strategically unstake just before proposals pass, then restake on new initiatives, maximising their influence across multiple proposals. This \"conviction hopping\" creates an arms race of strategic behaviour.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Execution Dependency**: Proposals must be manually executed once thresholds are met. If no one monitors conviction levels, passing proposals may languish. Automated keepers solve this but add infrastructure costs and centralisation points.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Computational Overhead**: Calculating conviction for all active proposals and stakeholders is gas-intensive. On Ethereum mainnet, conviction voting is impractical for large communities. Most implementations run on L2s or sidechains (Gnosis Chain, Polygon) where gas is cheaper.\n\t\t-\n\t- ### Comparison with Alternatives\n\t  collapsed:: true\n\t\t- **vs. [[BC-0466-quadratic-voting]]**: Quadratic voting uses quadratic costs to measure preference intensity through resource spending, whilst conviction voting uses time commitment. Quadratic voting requires discrete voting rounds and credit distribution decisions; conviction voting is continuous. Quadratic voting is vulnerable to Sybil attacks; conviction voting is not. However, quadratic voting can express opposition through negative votes; conviction voting cannot. Trade-off: conviction voting is simpler and more Sybil-resistant, quadratic voting is more expressive.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **vs. [[BC-0462-on-chain-voting]]**: Standard token-weighted voting gives immediate governance power proportional to holdings. Conviction voting dampens plutocracy through time requirements—even whales must wait. Token voting has clear start/end times; conviction voting is continuous. Token voting is simpler but creates whale dominance. Empirically, 1Hive analysis shows that conviction voting reduces the top 10% of holders' effective governance power from 75% (in token voting) to 58% (in conviction voting with 4-week average commitment), a modest but meaningful decentralisation.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **vs. [[BC-0469-snapshot-voting]]**: Snapshot provides gasless off-chain voting with flexible strategies. It can be combined with conviction voting by calculating conviction off-chain and verifying on-chain. However, pure Snapshot typically uses snapshot-based point-in-time voting, whilst conviction voting is inherently continuous. Snapshot is far more scalable (supporting thousands of voters easily); conviction voting faces gas constraints above 200-300 active stakers on-chain.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **vs. [[BC-0468-multi-sig-governance]]**: Multi-sig concentrates power in small committees (3-15 members) with binary approve/reject decisions. Conviction voting distributes power across all token holders with continuous preference expression. Multi-sig is extremely efficient and secure; conviction voting is more democratic but slower and more complex. Some DAOs use hybrid models: multi-sig for operational decisions, conviction voting for strategic resource allocation.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Trade-offs Summary**:\n\t\t- - **Simplicity**: Multi-sig > Token-weighted > Snapshot > Conviction > Quadratic\n\t\t- - **Preference intensity**: Conviction ≈ Quadratic > Token-weighted ≈ Snapshot > Multi-sig\n\t\t- - **Plutocracy resistance**: Quadratic > Conviction > Multi-sig > Snapshot > Token-weighted\n\t\t- - **Sybil resistance**: Multi-sig > Token-weighted ≈ Snapshot ≈ Conviction > Quadratic\n\t\t- - **Continuous operation**: Conviction > Multi-sig > Token-weighted ≈ Snapshot ≈ Quadratic\n\t\t- - **Gas efficiency**: Snapshot > Multi-sig > Token-weighted > Quadratic > Conviction\n\t\t-\n\t- ### Legal and Regulatory Aspects\n\t  collapsed:: true\n\t\t- **Securities Law and Continuous Governance**: Conviction voting's continuous nature creates interesting securities law questions. Traditional voting happens at shareholder meetings with clear record dates; conviction voting has no such boundaries. If governance tokens are deemed securities, the SEC may scrutinise whether conviction voting's continuous operation violates proxy voting rules requiring formal solicitation procedures. No regulatory guidance exists, but the mechanism's novelty could invite examination.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Fiduciary Duties in [[BC-0470-dao-legal-structures]]**: In Wyoming DAO LLCs or other legal wrappers, directors or members may have fiduciary duties that conflict with conviction voting's patient capital dynamics. If a proposal clearly benefits the DAO but lacks conviction for months while a few patient whales pursue personal preferences, does this violate duty of care? Traditional corporate law assumes active governance; conviction voting's passive accumulation may require new legal frameworks.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Investor Protection**: Conviction voting allows proposals to pass with relatively low participation. If 15% of tokens stake for a proposal over three months whilst 85% remain inactive, and the proposal later proves fraudulent or damaging, can inactive token holders claim they were denied adequate notice or voting rights? Traditional quorum requirements provide safe harbours; conviction voting's elimination of quorums may create liability exposure.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Tax Treatment of Staked Tokens**: When tokens are staked in conviction voting, are they still considered \"owned\" for tax purposes? In many jurisdictions, staking for proof-of-stake rewards creates taxable events, but conviction voting staking doesn't generate yield. HMRC and IRS have not addressed this specifically. Conservative interpretation suggests staking is not a taxable event, but unstaking and restaking frequently could trigger wash sale rules if tokens have fluctuating values.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Cross-Border Governance**: DAOs using conviction voting often have global token holder bases. If a proposal passes after accumulating conviction primarily from participants in one jurisdiction, does that create permanent establishment or tax nexus issues? For instance, if 70% of conviction comes from European stakers directing funds to a European project, does the DAO become subject to EU regulations? The continuous nature makes jurisdictional analysis complex.\n\t\t-\n\t- ### Best Practices\n\t  collapsed:: true\n\t\t- **Parameter Selection**:\n\t\t- - **Alpha (α)**: Start conservatively (0.99) for new communities, allowing 2-4 week proposal timelines. More established communities can reduce to 0.95 for faster decisions (1-2 weeks).\n\t\t- - **Beta (β)**: Set based on risk tolerance. Conservative treasuries: β = 0.4-0.5 (proposals need high conviction relative to amount). Growth-focused: β = 0.1-0.2 (easier passage).\n\t\t- - **Spending Limit (γ)**: Limit to 10-15% of treasury per month initially. Mature communities with stable revenue can increase to 20-25%.\n\t\t- - **Minimum Conviction**: Set absolute minimum (e.g., 5% of circulating tokens) to prevent spam, regardless of requested amount.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Proposal Hygiene**:\n\t\t- - Require structured proposal templates: purpose, budget, deliverables, timeline, beneficiary\n\t\t- - Implement proposal deposits (e.g., 1% of requested amount) refunded on passage but slashed on fraud\n\t\t- - Maximum proposal size limits (e.g., no more than 20% of treasury in single proposal)\n\t\t- - Cooling-off periods between similar proposals from same submitter (prevent spam)\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **UI/UX Design**:\n\t\t- - Visualise conviction curves showing projected passage time under current staking\n\t\t- - Display conviction as percentage of required threshold, not absolute numbers\n\t\t- - Prominent warnings when unstaking will significantly delay proposal passage\n\t\t- - Mobile notifications when staked proposals approach threshold\n\t\t- - Historical analytics showing successful proposal conviction patterns\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Community Education**:\n\t\t- - Interactive tutorials demonstrating conviction growth and decay\n\t\t- - Case studies from successful conviction voting communities\n\t\t- - Regular AMAs explaining parameter choices and their effects\n\t\t- - \"Conviction ambassadors\" who help new members understand staking strategies\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Security Measures**:\n\t\t- - Dispute/challenge mechanisms (Celeste, Aragon Court) to contest passing proposals before execution\n\t\t- - Multi-sig emergency pause for conviction voting contract\n\t\t- - Time delays between conviction threshold met and execution (24-72 hours for community review)\n\t\t- - Maximum proposal lifetime (e.g., 90 days) to force reproposal with updated information\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Hybrid Governance Models**:\n\t\t- - Use conviction voting for treasury/grants allocation (continuous spending decisions)\n\t\t- - Use snapshot voting for protocol parameters (discrete technical decisions)\n\t\t- - Use multi-sig for emergency responses (security incidents)\n\t\t- - Clear documentation of which decisions use which mechanism\n\t\t-\n\t- ### Future Developments\n\t  collapsed:: true\n\t\t- **Conviction Voting with Delegation**: Current implementations require direct staking. Future systems may allow delegation where token holders delegate conviction power to trusted community members, combining conviction's time-weighting with representative governance. The [[Optimism]] Collective is researching this for their Citizens' House.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Cross-Proposal Conviction Caps**: To address patient capital dominance, new mechanisms may limit how many proposals a single address can simultaneously stake on, or cap total conviction from individual addresses. This would force whales to prioritise, reducing their ability to support everything indefinitely.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Negative Conviction**: Experimental designs allow staking against proposals, with negative conviction that must be overcome. This creates true for/against dynamics whilst maintaining time-weighting benefits. Challenges include preventing gridlock where all proposals accumulate both positive and negative conviction.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Adaptive Parameters**: Machine learning models could adjust α, β, and γ based on treasury health, historical proposal success rates, and participation levels. If the treasury is growing faster than spending, α could decrease to speed proposals; if depleting, increase to slow down.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Layer 2 Scalability**: As L2s mature, conviction voting could scale to communities with thousands of active stakers. Optimistic rollups enable off-chain conviction calculation with fraud proofs for disputes, dramatically reducing gas costs.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Integration with [[BC-0469-snapshot-voting]]**: Snapshot could calculate conviction off-chain using historical staking data from multiple chains, then execute on-chain only when thresholds are met. This combines Snapshot's scalability with conviction's continuous preference expression.\n\t\t-\n\t\t- **Conviction Curves for Different Proposal Types**: Rather than uniform conviction growth, systems may implement different α values for different proposal categories—fast conviction growth for small grants (α = 0.95), slow for large expenditures (α = 0.997), creating automatic risk-adjusted approval processes.\n\t\t-\n\t- #\n\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable\n\n## References and Research\n\t  collapsed:: true\n\t\t- **Foundational Work**:\n\t\t- - Commons Stack.
