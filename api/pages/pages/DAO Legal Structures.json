Traditionally DAOs operated as unincorporated associations exposing members to unlimited liability and contractual ambiguity. Pioneering jurisdictions like Wyoming USA Marshall Islands and Switzerland introduced bespoke legal entities such as Wyoming DAO LLCs Marshall Islands Non-Profit DAOs and Swiss Associations offering limited liability tax clarity and legal personhood tailored to blockchain governance. These structures require varying degrees of off-chain disclosure such as registered agents or member lists balancing transparency with privacy. Wyoming's DAO LLC statute effective 2021 allows algorithmic governance via smart contracts while mandating articles of organisation and operating agreements bridging traditional corporate law with decentralised innovation. Similarly Cayman Islands and BVI provide pathways for DAOs managing substantial treasuries to operate within compliant legal wrappers. Challenges persist in jurisdictional arbitrage cross-border enforcement and reconciling immutable smart contract logic with mutable legal requirements. Emerging models include multi-jurisdictional hybrids and legal wrappers where the DAO remains decentralised while a parallel legal entity handles contracts employment and liability. EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation MiCA and UK's evolving stance further shape the landscape addressing governance accountability and member rights.\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n\t- DAOs are increasingly adopting formal legal structures to manage risk, facilitate compliance, and interact with traditional financial and legal systems\n\t- Common legal wrappers include limited liability partnerships, trusts, and foundations, with jurisdictions such as Wyoming (DAO LLCs), Guernsey, and the Cayman Islands offering tailored options\n- Notable organisations and platforms\n\t- Uniswap DAO, ENS DAO, and other prominent Web3 projects have implemented legal wrappers to manage governance and treasury operations\n\t- UK-based DAOs are beginning to adopt similar structures, often referencing English law in their constitutions and participation agreements\n- UK and North England examples where relevant\n\t- Manchester and Leeds have seen a rise in blockchain startups and DAO initiatives, with local legal firms and innovation hubs providing guidance on structuring DAOs under English law\n\t- Newcastle and Sheffield are emerging as regional centres for blockchain research and development, with academic institutions collaborating on DAO governance and compliance projects\n- Technical capabilities and limitations\n\t- Smart contracts enable automated governance and transparent decision-making, but legal wrappers are necessary to address issues such as liability, asset management, and regulatory compliance\n\t- The integration of legal wrappers can introduce complexity and potential points of centralisation, requiring careful design to maintain decentralised principles\n- Standards and frameworks\n\t- The Harmony Framework provides a methodical approach to the legal structuring of decentralised organisations, offering adaptable solutions for different jurisdictions\n\t- Industry standards are evolving, with ongoing efforts to harmonise legal and technical approaches to DAO governance\n\n## Technical Details\n\n- **Id**: bc-0470-dao-legal-structures-ontology\n- **Collapsed**: true\n- **Source Domain**: metaverse\n- **Status**: stub-needs-content\n- **Public Access**: true\n- **Content Status**: minimal-placeholder-requires-authoring\n- **Maturity**: draft\n- **Owl:Class**: bc:DAOLegalStructures\n- **Owl:Physicality**: ConceptualEntity\n- **Owl:Role**: Concept\n- **Belongstodomain**: [[BlockchainDomain]]\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers and sources\n\t- Korotana, S.
