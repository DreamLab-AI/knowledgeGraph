Ethical sourcing is more accurately characterised as a *governance objective* that blockchain technology enables, rather than merely a blockchain component. The distinction matters: ethical sourcing existed before blockchain; blockchain simply provides novel verification mechanisms. The updated entry reflects this nuance whilst maintaining technical precision and acknowledging the genuine limitations of technological solutions to fundamentally political and cultural challenges.\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Migration Status**: Ontology block enriched on 2025-11-12\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-12\n- **Review Status**: Comprehensive editorial review\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
