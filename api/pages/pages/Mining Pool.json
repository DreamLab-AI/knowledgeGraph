**What are Shares?**: Partial [[proof-of-work]] solutions that don't meet full [[Bitcoin]] [[difficulty]] but prove [[miner]] is working\n  - **Difficulty Adjustment**: Pool sets share [[difficulty]] lower than network [[difficulty]] (e.g., 1/10,000th)\n  - **Validation**: Pool server validates each share to prevent cheating\n  - **Accounting**: Shares track each [[miner]]'s proportional contribution to pool's total [[hash rate]]\n  -\n- **[[Stratum Protocol]]**\n  - **Purpose**: Efficient communication between [[miners]] and pool servers\n  - **Features**:\n    - Lightweight JSON-RPC protocol over TCP\n    - [[Difficulty]] adjustment per [[miner]]\n    - Job notifications for new [[blocks]]\n    - Share submission and validation\n  - **Limitations**: Pool controls [[block template]], creating centralization\n  -\n\n## Technical Details\n\n- **Id**: mining-pool-standards\n- **Collapsed**: true\n- **Domain Prefix**: BC\n- **Sequence Number**: 0064\n- **Filename History**: [\"BC-0064-mining-pool.md\"]\n- **Public Access**: true\n- **Source Domain**: blockchain\n- **Status**: complete\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-10-28\n- **Maturity**: mature\n- **Source**: [[ISO/IEC 23257:2021]], [[IEEE 2418.1]], [[NIST NISTIR]]\n- **Authority Score**: 0.95\n- **Owl:Class**: bc:MiningPool\n- **Owl:Physicality**: VirtualEntity\n- **Owl:Role**: Object\n- **Owl:Inferred Class**: bc:VirtualObject\n- **Belongstodomain**: [[ConsensusDomain]]\n- **Blockchainrelevance**: High\n- **Lastvalidated**: 2025-11-14\n- **Implementedinlayer**: [[ProtocolLayer]]\n- **Is Subclass Of**: [[Blockchain Entity]], [[ConsensusProtocol]]\n\n## Pool Reward Schemes\n\n- **[[PPLNS]] (Pay Per Last N Shares)**\n  - **Mechanism**: Rewards distributed based on last N [[shares]] when [[block]] is found\n  - **Variance**: Higher variance, rewards depend on pool's luck\n  - **Loyalty**: Discourages [[pool hopping]], rewards consistent [[miners]]\n  - **Typical N**: Last 5-10 times [[difficulty]] worth of [[shares]]\n  - **Pros**: No risk for pool operator, fair long-term distribution\n  - **Cons**: More variance for [[miners]], delayed first payment\n  -\n- **[[PPS]] (Pay Per Share)**\n  - **Mechanism**: Fixed payment per valid [[share]], regardless of [[block]] discovery\n  - **Variance**: Zero variance for [[miners]], pool assumes all risk\n  - **Payment**: Instant payment based on expected [[block]] reward value\n  - **Fees**: Higher fees (2-4%) due to pool's financial risk\n  - **Pros**: Completely predictable income for [[miners]]\n  - **Cons**: Higher fees, pool bankruptcy risk during bad luck\n  -\n- **[[PPS+]] (Pay Per Share Plus)**\n  - **Mechanism**: [[PPS]] for [[block reward]], [[PPLNS]] for [[transaction fees]]\n  - **Balance**: Lower pool risk while sharing [[transaction fee]] upside\n  - **Typical Fees**: 1.5-3%\n  - **Popular**: Used by [[Foundry USA]], [[F2Pool]], [[ViaBTC]]\n  -\n- **[[FPPS]] (Full Pay Per Share)**\n  -

**Job Declaration**: [[Miners]] negotiate work with pools\n  - **Status (2025)**: Adopted by [[Braiins Pool]], [[Luxor]], gradual rollout\n  - **Impact**: Reduces pool operator control over [[transaction]] selection\n  -\n- **[[Share Validation]] Systems**\n  - **Proof Verification**: Pools validate each [[share]]'s [[proof-of-work]]\n  - **[[Difficulty]] Scaling**: Adjusts per-[[miner]] [[difficulty]] based on [[hash rate]]\n  - **Cheat Detection**: Identifies [[miners]] submitting invalid [[shares]]\n  - **Orphan Handling**: Manages [[shares]] submitted during [[blockchain]] reorganizations\n  -\n\n## Mining Pool Economics\n\n- **Variance Reduction**\n  - **Solo Mining Variance**: Individual [[miner]] with 0.01% of network [[hash rate]] expects [[block]] every ~694 days\n  - **Pool Mining Variance**: Same [[miner]] in pool receives proportional rewards daily\n  - **Statistical Impact**: Pool reduces payout variance by 1,000-10,000x\n  - **Business Value**: Enables predictable revenue for operational planning\n  -\n- **Fee Structures**\n  - **Typical Fees**:\n    - [[PPLNS]]: 0.5-2%\n    - [[PPS]]: 2-4%\n    - [[PPS+]]: 1.5-3%\n    - [[FPPS]]: 2.5-4%\n  - **Fee Justification**: Infrastructure costs, payment processing, pool operator risk\n  - **Competitive Pressure**: Fees have decreased over time due to competition\n  -\n- **Profitability Comparison**\n  - **Example**: 100 TH/s [[miner]] at $0.05/kWh electricity, 3,000W consumption\n    - **Solo Mining**: Expected revenue ~$8/day, actual variance ±100%\n    - **Pool Mining ([[PPS+]])**: Guaranteed $7.76/day (2% fee), zero variance\n    - **Net Benefit**: $3.60/day electricity cost → ~$4.16/day profit (pool)\n  -\n\n## Centralization Concerns\n\n- **[[51% Attack]] Risk**\n  - **Threat**: Pool controlling >50% [[hash rate]] could execute [[double-spend attacks]]\n  - **Historical Events**:\n    - **2014**: [[GHash.IO]] briefly exceeded 50%, voluntarily reduced\n    - **2025**: Top 3 pools ([[Foundry USA]], [[AntPool]], [[F2Pool]]) control ~70%\n  - **Mitigation**: [[Miners]] can switch pools instantly, economic disincentives\n  -\n- **Geographic Concentration**\n  - **Historical Issue**: Pre-2021, ~65% [[hash rate]] in China\n  - **2021 China Ban**: Forced migration, now ~40% in North America, 20% Kazakhstan\n  - **Current Distribution (2025)**:\n    - United States: ~40%\n    - China: ~15% (despite ban)\n    - Kazakhstan: ~18%\n    - Russia: ~11%\n    - Other: ~16%\n  -\n- **[[Transaction]] Censorship**\n  - **Risk**: Pools could refuse to include specific [[transactions]]\n  - **Examples**: [[MARA Pool]] briefly filtered [[OFAC]]-sanctioned addresses (2023)\n  - **[[Stratum V2]] Solution**: Allows [[miners]] to construct own [[block templates]]\n  -\n\n## Solo Mining vs Pool Mining\n\n- **Solo Mining**\n  - **Pros**:\n    - No pool fees (keep 100% of [[block reward]])\n    - Complete control over [[transaction]] selection\n    - Maximum [[decentralization]]\n  - **Cons**:\n    - Extreme variance (months/years between payouts)\n    - Unpredictable revenue stream\n    - Requires significant [[hash rate]] for viability\n  - **Viable For**: Large [[mining farms]] with >1% network [[hash rate]]\n  -\n- **Pool Mining**\n  - **Pros**:\n    - Predictable, consistent revenue\n    - Lower variance enables business planning\n    - Professional infrastructure and support\n  - **Cons**:\n    - Pool fees reduce net revenue\n    - Less control over [[transaction]] inclusion\n    - Contributes to [[centralization]]\n  - **Viable For**: 99%+ of [[miners]], especially small operations\n  -\n\n## Pool Hopping & Countermeasures\n\n- **[[Pool Hopping]]**\n  - **Definition**: Strategy of switching between pools to exploit reward scheme weaknesses\n  - **Vulnerable Schemes**: Proportional, early [[PPLNS]] variants\n  - **Mechanism**: Join pool early in round, leave before [[block]] found\n  - **Impact**: Honest [[miners]] earn less, pool reputation damaged\n  -\n- **Countermeasures**\n  - **[[PPLNS]]**: Hopping-resistant by design, rewards consistent [[miners]]\n  - **Score-Based**: Weight recent [[shares]] higher than old [[shares]]\n  - **Minimum Payout**: Requires minimum [[shares]] before first payment\n  - **Detection**: Pools monitor for suspicious switching patterns\n  -\n\n## Mining Pool Software\n\n- **[[BTCPool]]** (Open Source)\n  - **Developer**: [[Bitmain Technologies]]\n  - **Features**: Full pool infrastructure, [[Stratum]] support, multiple reward schemes\n  -

**Scale**: Handles 35% of global [[Bitcoin]] [[hash rate]]\n  -\n\n## Academic Context\n\n- [[Mining pools]] are collaborative networks where individual [[cryptocurrency]] [[miners]] combine [[computational resources]] to increase the probability of successfully mining new [[blocks]] on a [[blockchain]].\n  - This collective approach emerged as a response to the increasing [[difficulty]] of [[mining]] puzzles, which made [[solo mining]] increasingly impractical after [[Bitcoin]]'s early years.\n  - The foundational academic understanding of [[mining pools]] is grounded in [[distributed computing]], [[game theory]], and [[cryptographic]] [[consensus mechanisms]], particularly [[proof-of-work]] (PoW).\n  - Early research highlighted the trade-offs between [[decentralization]] and efficiency, with [[mining pools]] offering more consistent rewards but raising concerns about [[centralization]] risks.\n  -\n- **Key Academic Research Areas**\n  - **[[Selfish Mining]]**: Eyal & Sirer (2014) demonstrated that pools can gain advantages by strategically withholding [[blocks]]\n  - **[[Block Withholding]] Attacks**: Courtois & Bahack (2014) analysed sabotage strategies in [[mining pools]]\n  -

**Energy Efficiency**: 15-20 J/TH (joules per terahash), down from 100+ J/TH in 2015\n  - **Pool Software**: [[Stratum V2]] adoption at ~15%, expected 50%+ by 2026\n  - **Renewable Energy**: ~58% of [[Bitcoin]] [[mining]] uses renewable sources (2025)\n  - **AI Optimization**: Pools use [[machine learning]] for [[difficulty]] prediction, energy scheduling\n  -\n- **Industry Standards Evolution**\n  - **[[Stratum V2]]** ([[BIP 310]]): Standardises [[decentralized]] [[block template]] construction\n  - **Transparency Initiatives**: Real-time [[hash rate]] monitoring, public payout records\n  - **Regulatory Compliance**: KYC/AML requirements in regulated jurisdictions\n  - **[[Energy Efficiency]] Standards**: Industry push for renewable energy reporting\n  -\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- **Foundational Academic Works**\n  -
