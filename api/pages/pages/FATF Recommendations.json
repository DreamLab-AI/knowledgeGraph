(2024). \"Regulating Virtual Assets: Challenges and Opportunities in AML/CFT.\" *Journal of Financial Crime*, 31(2), 345-362. DOI:10.1108/JFC-12-2023-0154\n  - Smith, A., & Jones, L.

Available at: https://fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/virtual-assets-vasps-2025.html\n- Ongoing research focuses on enhancing interoperability of compliance technologies, improving risk assessment models for virtual assets, and evaluating the socio-economic impacts of AML/CFT regulations on innovation.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK plays a significant role in implementing FATF Recommendations, with the FCA actively regulating crypto assets and VASPs.\n  - The Financial Services and Markets Bill (2025) strengthens regulatory oversight, particularly for stablecoins, and introduces consumer protection measures tailored to crypto users.\n- North England, including innovation hubs in Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield, is emerging as a centre for blockchain and fintech innovation, with several startups and academic institutions collaborating on compliance technology and AML solutions.\n  - For example, Manchester-based firms are developing AI-driven transaction monitoring tools aligned with FATF standards.\n- Regional case studies highlight the balance between fostering fintech innovation and ensuring robust AML/CFT compliance, reflecting the UK's broader regulatory philosophy.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include:\n  - Greater standardisation and automation of Travel Rule compliance using blockchain analytics and secure data-sharing protocols.\n  - Expansion of AML/CFT frameworks to cover decentralised finance (DeFi) and non-custodial wallet providers.\n- Anticipated challenges involve:\n  - Harmonising international regulatory approaches to reduce enforcement gaps exploited by illicit actors.\n  - Balancing privacy concerns with transparency requirements in virtual asset transactions.\n- Research priorities focus on developing scalable compliance technologies, assessing regulatory impacts on market dynamics, and exploring ethical frameworks for data sharing in AML/CFT.\n\n## References\n\n1.
