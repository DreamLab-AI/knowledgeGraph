Originally proposed by economist Glen Weyl, it addresses the tyranny of the majority by allowing minorities to signal strong preferences while preventing plutocratic dominance. In blockchain ecosystems, quadratic voting has gained traction within Decentralised Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), grant allocation systems like Gitcoin Grants, and token-weighted governance frameworks. The mechanism balances influence distribution where a participant desiring 10 votes must spend 100 units of voting power, incentivising thoughtful allocation rather than vote-buying. Implementations leverage smart contracts to enforce quadratic cost curves transparently and immutably, though challenges persist in Sybil resistance where actors create multiple identities to game the system. Solutions include identity verification layers such as BrightID or Proof of Humanity and zero-knowledge proofs preserving privacy while ensuring one-person-one-vote integrity. Real-world adoption includes Gitcoin's quadratic funding rounds distributing millions in public goods funding and experimental DAO governance in MolochDAO variants. Research continues into hybrid models combining quadratic voting with conviction voting or delegation mechanisms.\n\n- Quadratic voting (QV) represents a voting mechanism designed to reflect the intensity of participants' preferences in collective decision-making[1][4]\n  - Fundamentally distinct from one-person-one-vote systems by allowing voters to express preference strength through resource allocation\n  - Operates on the principle that voting power acquisition follows a convex cost function, where the nth vote costs n tokens (or equivalent units)[2][4]\n  - Emerged from theoretical work in mechanism design and democratic innovation, gaining particular traction in blockchain governance contexts\n  - Addresses the tyranny of the majority by enabling nuanced preference aggregation rather than binary or plurality outcomes[4]\n\n## Technical Details\n\n- **Id**: bc-0466-quadratic-voting-ontology\n- **Collapsed**: true\n- **Source Domain**: blockchain\n- **Status**: stub-needs-content\n- **Public Access**: true\n- **Content Status**: minimal-placeholder-requires-authoring\n- **Maturity**: draft\n- **Owl:Class**: bc:QuadraticVoting\n- **Owl:Physicality**: ConceptualEntity\n- **Owl:Role**: Concept\n- **Belongstodomain**: [[BlockchainDomain]]\n- **Blockchainrelevance**: High\n- **Lastvalidated**: 2025-11-14\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Blockchain and decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs) represent primary implementation domains[2]\n  - Axelar Network has integrated quadratic voting into delegated proof-of-stake systems to mitigate stake concentration risks[2]\n  - Ethereum governance experiments have explored QV applications, though widespread adoption remains limited despite theoretical advantages[2]\n  - RadicalxChange community maintains active polling infrastructure using QV methodologies[1]\n  - UK and North England context: Limited documented implementations in regional blockchain initiatives; however, academic interest exists within UK computer science departments, particularly those researching distributed systems and governance mechanisms\n- Technical capabilities and limitations\n  - Enables voters to allocate voting power across multiple options whilst maintaining preference intensity signals[3]\n  - Three primary implementation variants identified: Type 1 (square root applied to total stake before distribution), Type 2 (distribution before square root application), and Type 3 (unsplit stake allocation)[3]\n  - Formal proofs confirm that Types 2 and 3 QV, along with generalised models, maintain mathematical properties conducive to decentralisation[3]\n  - Limitations include computational complexity, potential collusion vulnerabilities, and the requirement for robust token or stake systems[1]\n  - Voter education challenges persist; the mechanism's sophistication can create barriers to participation among less technically literate participants\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - No universally adopted technical standard currently exists; implementations vary by platform\n  - RadicalxChange provides community guidance and case study documentation[1]\n  - Academic literature increasingly formalises QV variants and their theoretical properties[3]\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers and sources\n  - Kovalchuk, L., Rodinko, M., Oliynykov, R., Nastenko, A., Kaidalov, D., & Nelson, K.

Time-sensitive content regarding specific 2020 Colorado experiments and Ethereum governance trials has been contextualised historically rather than removed, as they represent important precedents. UK context remains limited due to genuine scarcity of regional implementations—this represents an honest gap rather than an oversight. The mechanism's sophistication occasionally makes it rather more intellectually demanding than a simple ballot box, which is worth acknowledging candidly.\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Migration Status**: Ontology block enriched on 2025-11-12\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-12\n- **Review Status**: Comprehensive editorial review\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
