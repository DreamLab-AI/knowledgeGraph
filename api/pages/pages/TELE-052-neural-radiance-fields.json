(ECCV 2020), revolutionised 3D scene reconstruction by representing scenes as continuous neural functions rather than discrete meshes or voxels. A NeRF encodes a scene's geometry and appearance in the weights of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) that, given a 3D position (x, y, z) and viewing direction (θ, φ), outputs colour (RGB) and volume density (σ). Novel viewpoints are rendered by marching rays through the volume, sampling the neural function, and integrating colour/density via volumetric rendering equations, producing photorealistic images without explicit 3D geometry.\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\nNeRF has spawned 1,000+ research papers and commercial applications in telepresence [[TELE-053-volumetric-video-conferencing]], virtual production, and VR [[TELE-020-virtual-reality-telepresence]].\n\n**Technology Capabilities (2025)**:\n- **Training Time**: 30 minutes for room-scale scenes (Instant-NGP [[TELE-060-instant-ngp]])\n- **Rendering Speed**: 30 FPS real-time variants (Mobile-NeRF, TensoRF)\n- **Quality**: 32-36 dB PSNR (exceeding mesh-based methods)\n\n## Comparison to Gaussian Splatting\n\nNeRF slower but more memory-efficient than [[TELE-051-3d-gaussian-splatting]]. Gaussian splatting now preferred for real-time telepresence.\n\n## Related Concepts\n\n- [[TELE-050-neural-rendering-telepresence]]\n- [[TELE-051-3d-gaussian-splatting]]\n- [[TELE-053-volumetric-video-conferencing]]\n\n## Academic References\n\n1.
