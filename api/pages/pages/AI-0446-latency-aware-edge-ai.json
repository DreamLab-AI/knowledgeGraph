These systems continuously monitor network conditions, device load, and inference deadlines, selecting optimal inference strategies from a portfolio of options. Dynamic model selection automatically chooses different neural network architectures (fast shallow networks versus accurate deep networks) based on available time budget; 50ms deadline might use lightweight EfficientNet-B0 while 500ms deadline allows ResNet-50. Adaptive offloading intelligently routes inference between edge and cloud: simple queries execute locally within milliseconds, complex requests offload to cloud when network latency allows before deadline expiration. Cascading inference employs early-exit networks that provide predictions at intermediate layers, reducing latency when initial predictions carry sufficient confidence. Adaptive batching accumulates multiple inference requests into batches for efficient processing when time permits; streaming requests process individually for minimal latency. Latency prediction models estimate execution time for different model-hardware combinations, enabling runtime scheduling decisions. Quality-of-Service awareness trades inference accuracy against latency; 99.9% deadline-meeting rates prioritize latency over marginal accuracy improvements. Systems maintain P99 latency under 50ms, jitter under 2ms, and 60+ FPS throughput for real-time video processing. Applications include video analytics requiring <33ms response for 30 FPS processing, autonomous vehicle perception handling 100ms deadlines for safety-critical decisions, and mobile augmented reality maintaining 16.7ms frames. Scheduling algorithms employ priority queues and fair scheduling preventing high-priority queries from starvation. Latency-aware systems represent the maturation of edge computing, moving beyond best-effort inference toward predictable real-time performance meeting application demands.\n\t- maturity:: mature\n\t- owl:class:: ai:LatencyAwareEdgeAI\n\t- owl:physicality:: VirtualEntity\n\t- owl:role:: Process\n\t- owl:inferred-class:: aigo:VirtualProcess\n\t- belongsToDomain:: [[AIEthicsDomain]]\n\t- implementedInLayer:: [[ConceptualLayer]]",
