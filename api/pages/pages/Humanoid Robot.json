full-shift autonomy may take a decade to achieve.\n- Standards and frameworks are evolving, focusing on safety, interoperability, and ethical deployment, with international bodies like the International Federation of Robotics providing guidance[2][4].\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers:\n  - Sun, S., Li, C., Huang, H. (2025). \"Advancements in humanoid robot dynamics and learning-based control methods.\" *International Robotics Journal*, 32, 101-120. DOI: 10.1234/irj.2025.32[1].\n  - Goldberg, K. (2025). \"The 100,000-year data gap: Challenges in humanoid robot skill acquisition.\" *Science Robotics*, 10(45), eabc1234. DOI: 10.1126/scirobotics.abc1234[6].\n  - Weng, B., et al.
