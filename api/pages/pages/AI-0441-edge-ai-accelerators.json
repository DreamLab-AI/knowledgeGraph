These include Neural Processing Units (NPUs), Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) optimized for neural network computations. NPUs integrate directly into mobile processors (Qualcomm Hexagon, Apple Neural Engine) achieving 2-21 TOPS (tera-operations per second) with 2-10 TOPS per watt efficiency. TPUs and ASICs deliver peak performance 5-100x higher than CPUs while consuming 10-50x less power per inference. FPGAs offer programmable flexibility allowing deployment-specific optimizations when fixed-function accelerators are unavailable. Edge AI accelerators exploit parallelism in matrix multiplication operations inherent to neural networks, typically supporting low-precision arithmetic (INT8, FP16) for dramatic speedups versus full-precision FP32 computation. Hardware features including dedicated memory hierarchies, reduced precision datapaths, and specialized reduction circuits eliminate unnecessary energy overhead from general-purpose processors. Platforms like NVIDIA Jetson embed GPUs for accelerated inference on mobile robots and autonomous vehicles. Meta's Orion custom silicon combines custom accelerators for AR processing at mobile-friendly power budgets. Edge accelerators enable real-time video processing, low-latency autonomous responses, and offline operation while respecting power and thermal constraints. The trend toward tightly integrated AI accelerators reflects the fundamental mismatch between neural network parallelism and general-purpose processor design, necessitating specialized hardware for practical edge intelligence.\n\t- maturity:: mature\n\t- owl:class:: ai:EdgeAIAccelerators\n\t- owl:physicality:: VirtualEntity\n\t- owl:role:: Process\n\t- owl:inferred-class:: aigo:VirtualProcess\n\t- belongsToDomain:: [[AIEthicsDomain]]\n\t- implementedInLayer:: [[ConceptualLayer]]",
