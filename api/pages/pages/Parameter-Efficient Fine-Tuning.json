PEFT methods enable adaptation of large models with limited resources.\n\n## Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning\n\nParameter Efficient Fine Tuning refers to training techniques that update only a small subset of model parameters during fine-tuning, reducing computational and memory requirements whilst maintaining comparable performance to full fine-tuning. peft methods enable adaptation of large models with limited resources.\n\n- PEFT has become a mainstream approach in industry for adapting large language models (LLMs) and other AI models, enabling faster, cheaper, and more resource-efficient fine-tuning.\n  - Notable methods include Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which injects low-rank trainable matrices into transformer layers, and its quantized variant QLoRA, which further reduces storage needs[6].\n  - PEFT typically updates between 1% to 10% of model parameters, drastically cutting training time and hardware demands while preserving model quality[3].\n- Organisations across sectors use PEFT to tailor large models to specific domains, languages, or customer needs without incurring the prohibitive costs of full fine-tuning.\n- In the UK, and particularly in North England, AI research hubs and tech companies in Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield increasingly adopt PEFT to develop domain-specific AI solutions.\n  - These centres leverage PEFT to overcome local infrastructure constraints and accelerate AI deployment in healthcare, finance, and manufacturing.\n- Despite its advantages, PEFT involves trade-offs: fully fine-tuned models may offer marginally better performance and more control, but PEFT is preferred when computational resources or data are limited[6].\n- Standards and frameworks for PEFT are evolving, with growing emphasis on interoperability, reproducibility, and benchmarking across different model architectures and tasks.\n\n## Technical Details\n\n- **Id**: parameter-efficient-fine-tuning-ontology\n- **Collapsed**: true\n- **Source Domain**: ai\n- **Status**: draft\n- **Public Access**: true\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers and surveys provide comprehensive overviews and comparisons of PEFT methods:\n  - Hu et al.
