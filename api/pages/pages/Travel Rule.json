W., Barberis, J., & Buckley, R. P. (2023). \"Regulating Crypto-Assets: The FATF Travel Rule and Beyond.\" *Journal of Financial Regulation*, 9(2), 123-145.

DOI:10.1016/j.irle.2023.101118\n- Ongoing research focuses on:\n  - Enhancing interoperability between disparate VASP systems.\n  - Developing privacy-preserving compliance technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs.\n  - Analysing the socio-economic impact of Travel Rule enforcement on crypto adoption and financial inclusion.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK has been proactive in aligning its regulatory framework with FATF standards, with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) overseeing VASP compliance.\n  - British fintech firms are innovating in AML/CTF solutions that incorporate Travel Rule requirements, often collaborating with academic institutions.\n- North England is notable for its growing blockchain ecosystem:\n  - Manchester hosts several blockchain accelerators and compliance tech startups focusing on Travel Rule implementation.\n  - Leeds and Sheffield universities contribute research on regulatory technology and cryptographic methods to support secure data sharing.\n  - Newcastle’s fintech community is active in developing practical tools for VASPs to meet Travel Rule obligations efficiently.\n- Regional case studies demonstrate successful pilot projects integrating Travel Rule compliance into local crypto exchanges and payment platforms, balancing regulatory demands with user experience.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include:\n  - Greater automation of compliance processes using artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect suspicious transactions in real time.\n  - Expansion of Travel Rule applicability to decentralised finance (DeFi) platforms, which currently pose regulatory challenges due to their peer-to-peer nature.\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Harmonising global regulatory standards to reduce fragmentation and compliance costs.\n  - Protecting user privacy while ensuring sufficient transparency for law enforcement.\n- Research priorities:\n  - Developing scalable, privacy-enhancing technologies that satisfy both regulatory and user demands.\n  - Evaluating the impact of Travel Rule enforcement on innovation and market dynamics within the UK and internationally.\n\n## References\n\n1.
