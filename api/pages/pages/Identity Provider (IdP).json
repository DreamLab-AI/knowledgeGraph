(2012). The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework. RFC 6749. DOI: 10.17487/RFC6749\n  - Cantor, S., Kemp, J., Philpott, R., & Maler, E. (2005).

OpenID Connect Core 1.0. URL: https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html\n  - Research continues on enhancing IdP security against phishing and identity theft, improving privacy-preserving authentication, and enabling decentralized identity models.\n- Ongoing research directions include:\n  - Integration of blockchain and decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to reduce reliance on centralised IdPs.\n  - Use of AI to detect anomalous authentication behaviour.\n  - Enhancing usability without compromising security, especially in multi-factor and passwordless authentication.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK government and private sector have adopted IdP technologies to support digital identity frameworks such as GOV.UK Verify, which relies on federated identity principles.\n- North England hosts innovation clusters focusing on cybersecurity and identity management, with universities and tech companies collaborating on projects to improve identity assurance and privacy.\n- Regional case studies include NHS trusts in Manchester implementing federated IdPs to enable secure access to patient data across multiple healthcare providers, balancing accessibility with compliance to UK data protection laws.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends:\n  - Increased adoption of passwordless authentication and biometric verification integrated into IdPs.\n  - Greater emphasis on privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) within identity management.\n  - Expansion of IdP roles to support Internet of Things (IoT) and machine-to-machine authentication.\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Balancing user convenience with stringent security requirements.\n  - Managing trust and interoperability in increasingly complex federated environments.\n  - Addressing regulatory changes and cross-border data sharing concerns.\n- Research priorities:\n  - Developing standards for decentralized and self-sovereign identity (SSI).\n  - Enhancing resilience of IdPs against sophisticated cyberattacks.\n  - Improving transparency and user control over identity data.\n\n## References\n\n1.
