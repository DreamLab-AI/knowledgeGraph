This approach implements encryption schemes where operations on encrypted data produce encrypted results that, when decrypted, match results of operations on plaintext, formalized as Decrypt(Encrypt(m1) ⊕ Encrypt(m2)) = m1 + m2 for addition and Decrypt(Encrypt(m1) ⊗ Encrypt(m2)) = m1 × m2 for multiplication. Scheme types include partially homomorphic encryption supporting only addition (Paillier) or only multiplication (RSA), somewhat homomorphic encryption permitting limited operations before noise accumulation requires decryption, and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enabling arbitrary computations on encrypted data through bootstrapping refreshing ciphertexts to control noise growth, implemented in schemes like BGV, BFV for integer arithmetic, and CKKS for approximate arithmetic on real/complex numbers suitable for machine learning. ML applications include encrypted inference where clients encrypt inputs, servers perform encrypted prediction, and clients decrypt results without server seeing plaintext data, federated learning with clients encrypting model updates before aggregation preventing coordinator privacy breaches, and collaborative training enabling multiple parties to jointly train models on combined encrypted datasets without exposing individual contributions. The 2024-2025 period witnessed homomorphic encryption mature sufficiently for commercial deployment with Microsoft's SEAL library and IBM's HELib enabling encrypted computation, Intel SGX and ARM TrustZone providing hardware-backed confidential computing, and sectors including healthcare, finance, and government adopting PPML for regulatory-compliant training on sensitive data, though substantial challenges remained including 10-100x computational overhead compared to plaintext operations, complexity of parameter selection balancing security and performance, and limited operation support with neural network architectures requiring approximations.\n\t- source:: [[Microsoft SEAL]], [[IBM HELib]], [[CKKS Scheme]]\n\t- maturity:: mature\n\t- owl:class:: ai:HomomorphicEncryptionForMachineLearning\n\t- owl:physicality:: VirtualEntity\n\t- owl:role:: Process\n\t- owl:inferred-class:: aigo:VirtualProcess\n\t- belongsToDomain:: [[AIEthicsDomain]]\n\t- implementedInLayer:: [[ConceptualLayer]]",
