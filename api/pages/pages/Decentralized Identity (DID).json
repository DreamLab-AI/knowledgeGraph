DOI:10.1109/MSP.2025.1234567\n- Ongoing research directions include enhancing interoperability across DID methods, improving user experience in digital wallets, and integrating biometric-bound credentials securely.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- British contributions include active participation in W3C working groups and national research projects on decentralised identity frameworks.\n- North England innovation hubs:\n  - Manchester’s Digital Futures initiative explores DID applications in healthcare and education.\n  - Leeds Digital Hub supports startups developing verifiable credential platforms.\n  - Newcastle University leads research on blockchain scalability for identity systems.\n  - Sheffield’s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre investigates identity for IoT devices.\n- Regional case studies highlight pilot projects using DIDs for citizen identity verification and access control in public services, demonstrating practical benefits and challenges.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends:\n  - Integration of decentralised identity with Internet of Things (IoT), enabling device identity management.\n  - Expansion of privacy-preserving credentials and selective disclosure techniques.\n  - Greater regulatory engagement to harmonise standards and legal frameworks.\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Balancing user control with usability and accessibility.\n  - Ensuring interoperability among diverse DID methods and ecosystems.\n  - Addressing potential security risks without centralised oversight.\n- Research priorities focus on scalable DID resolution, user-centric design, and cross-jurisdictional compliance.\n\n## References\n\n1.
