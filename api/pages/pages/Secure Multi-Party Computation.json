This technique provides privacy guarantees through mathematical protocols where each party holds secret input x_i, parties execute cryptographic protocol computing function f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n), and only the result is revealed while intermediate values remain hidden, with security models including semi-honest (honest-but-curious) adversaries following protocol but attempting to infer extra information, and malicious adversaries arbitrarily deviating from protocol requiring verification mechanisms. Implementation techniques span secret sharing methods where values are split into shares distributed across parties enabling computation through share manipulation (Shamir secret sharing for n parties with threshold t, replicated secret sharing for 3-party protocols), garbled circuits where one party creates encrypted circuit and another evaluates it without learning inputs or intermediate values (suitable for 2-party boolean circuits), and oblivious transfer primitives enabling receiver to obtain one of sender's inputs without sender knowing which was chosen or receiver learning others. ML applications include privacy-preserving model evaluation where parties jointly evaluate ML models without exposing proprietary models or sensitive test data, federated learning with secure aggregation preventing server from seeing individual participant updates even during aggregation, and private benchmarking enabling companies to compare ML model performance without revealing architectures or proprietary data.

Enables multiple parties to jointly compute results from private data without exposing underlying datasets to one another[1]\n  - Differs fundamentally from traditional encryption by protecting data throughout the computation process itself, not merely during storage or transmission[1]\n  - Transforms data sharing from \"data surrender\" into privacy by design[1]\n  - Now recognised as a cornerstone of next-generation privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) rather than purely academic concept[1]\n\n## Technical Details\n\n- **Id**: secure-multi-party-computation-about\n- **Collapsed**: true\n- **Domain Prefix**: AI\n- **Sequence Number**: 0419\n- **Filename History**: [\"AI-0419-Secure-Multi-Party-Computation.md\"]\n- **Public Access**: true\n- **Source Domain**: ai\n- **Status**: in-progress\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-10-29\n- **Maturity**: mature\n- **Source**: [[Yao's Garbled Circuits]], [[Shamir Secret Sharing]], [[MP-SPDZ]]\n- **Authority Score**: 0.95\n- **Owl:Class**: aigo:SecureMultiPartyComputation\n- **Owl:Physicality**: VirtualEntity\n- **Owl:Role**: Process\n- **Owl:Inferred Class**: aigo:VirtualProcess\n- **Belongstodomain**: [[AIEthicsDomain]]\n- **Implementedinlayer**: [[ConceptualLayer]]\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  -

Microsoft research advancing communication-efficient protocols combining SMPC with differential privacy for distributed machine learning training—achieving 56–794× improvement in communication efficiency over previous approaches[4]\n- Technical capabilities and limitations\n  - Three-party computation (3PC) protocols particularly relevant for semi-honest settings due to low bandwidth requirements and applicability of information-theoretic security techniques[2]\n  - Four-party computation (4PC) protocols enable efficient verification of message correctness through redundancy of secretly shared values[2]\n  - Recent protocol innovations reduce global communication requirements per multiplication gate[2]\n  - Ongoing challenge: balancing computational efficiency with security guarantees across different corruption models (semi-honest versus malicious adversaries)[2]\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Privacy-enhancing technologies framework increasingly incorporating SMPC as standard component[1]\n  - Protocols standardised for three and four-party settings with formal security proofs[2]\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers and sources\n  -
