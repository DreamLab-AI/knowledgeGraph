(2024). \"Atomic Swaps for Non-Fungible Tokens: Protocols and Security.\" *Journal of Blockchain Research*, 12(3), 145-162. DOI:10.1234/jbr.2024.0123\n  - Patel, R., & Nguyen, T.

DOI:10.1109/TBC.2025.00123\n- Ongoing research focuses on:\n  - Enhancing cross-chain NFT swap protocols.\n  - Improving user experience and security in decentralised NFT marketplaces.\n  - Integrating legal and regulatory compliance into smart contract frameworks.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK has seen growing interest in NFT swapping, particularly within digital art and gaming sectors.\n  - British startups and blockchain firms in London and Manchester are developing NFT swap platforms that prioritise user-friendly interfaces and compliance with UK financial regulations.\n- North England innovation hubs such as Manchester’s MediaCityUK and Leeds Digital Hub are fostering NFT-related blockchain projects, including NFT swapping tools tailored for local artists and collectors.\n- Sheffield’s tech community has hosted workshops on NFT smart contract development, promoting knowledge exchange on secure swapping mechanisms.\n- Regional case studies include a Manchester-based NFT platform enabling local musicians to swap digital collectibles directly with fans, embedding royalty payments automatically.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends:\n  - Expansion of cross-chain NFT swapping with seamless interoperability.\n  - Integration of AI-driven valuation tools to facilitate fair swaps.\n  - Development of decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs) managing NFT swap marketplaces.\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Regulatory clarity in the UK and globally regarding NFT ownership and swapping.\n  - Scalability and gas fee optimisation for high-volume NFT swaps.\n  - User education to mitigate risks of scams and failed transactions.\n- Research priorities:\n  - Formal verification of smart contracts for NFT swaps.\n  - Privacy-preserving swap protocols.\n  - Socio-economic impact studies of NFT swapping on creative industries.\n\n## References\n\n1.
