They act as a regulatory bridge ensuring third-country AI systems meet EU AI Act requirements.\n\n## Key Characteristics\n\n### Who Qualifies as Importer?\n\n#### Geographic Requirements\n- **Importer location**: Established in EU/EEA\n- **AI system origin**: Third country (non-EU)\n- **Provider location**: Established outside EU\n\n#### Placing on Market Activity\n- **First making available** in EU under third-country provider's name/trademark\n- **Commercial activity**: Whether payment or free of charge\n\n### Distinction from Distributor\n- **Importer**: First EU placement from third country\n- **Distributor**: Subsequent supply after placement\n\n### Distinction from Authorised Representative\n- **Importer**: Places on market in own capacity\n- **Authorised Representative**: Acts on non-EU provider's behalf (Article 22)\n\n## Importer Obligations for High-Risk AI (Article 23)\n\n### Pre-Placement Verification (Article 23(1))\n\nBefore placing on market, importers must verify:\n\n#### 1. Conformity Assessment Completion\n- Provider has conducted conformity assessment (Article 43)\n- Assessment documentation available\n\n#### 2. Technical Documentation Availability\n- Technical documentation prepared per Annex IV\n- Accessible to market surveillance authorities\n\n#### 3. CE Marking Affixation\n- CE marking properly affixed by provider\n- Notified body number (if applicable) present\n\n#### 4. Instructions for Use Provision\n- Instructions accompany system\n- In language(s) acceptable to deployers in target Member State\n\n#### 5. Provider Obligations Compliance\n- Provider has fulfilled Article 16 requirements\n- Non-EU provider has authorised representative OR importer assumes responsibility\n\n### Identification Requirements (Article 23(2))\n\nImporters must indicate on AI system:\n- **Own name**\n- **Own trade name or trademark**\n- **Postal address**\n- **Contact details** (email, website)\n\n**Where indicated**: System itself or packaging or accompanying documentation\n\n**Traceability purpose**: Enable identification of importer in supply chain\n\n### Documentation and Compliance Maintenance (Article 23(3))\n\n#### EU Declaration of Conformity\n- Ensure declaration available to market surveillance authorities\n- Maintain copy for 10 years after placement\n\n#### Cooperation with Authorities\n- Provide authorities with all information and documentation to demonstrate:\n  - System compliance\n  - Provider compliance\n  - Import legality\n\n#### Language\nEnsure documentation in language:\n- Easily understood by authorities\n- Of Member State where system made available\n\n### Storage and Transport (Article 23(4))\nEnsure conditions during:\n- Storage\n- Transport\n\nDo not jeopardise compliance with requirements.\n\n### Traceability (Article 23(5))\nMaintain for **10 years** after placing on market:\n- AI system identification (name, type, batch, serial)\n- Non-EU provider details\n- Distributors supplied\n- Import dates and quantities\n\n## Non-Compliance Response (Article 23(6))\n\nWhen importer considers or has reason to believe AI system **non-compliant**:\n\n### Step 1: Do Not Place\n- **Prohibition**: Do not place on market\n- **Duration**: Until compliance ensured\n\n### Step 2: Inform Provider\n- Notify non-EU provider\n- Request corrective action\n\n### Step 3: Inform Authorities (if serious risk)\n- Market surveillance authority\n- Provide details of non-compliance\n\n### Step 4: Corrective Actions (if already placed)\nIf system already on market and non-compliance discovered:\n- Immediately inform provider\n- Inform market surveillance authorities\n- Take corrective action (withdrawal, recall)\n\n## Cooperation Obligations (Article 25)\n\nUpon market surveillance authority request:\n\n### Information Provision\n- All information and documentation necessary to demonstrate compliance\n- In language acceptable to authority\n- Promptly (typically within days)\n\n### Sample and Access\n- Provide AI system samples\n- Grant access for examination\n- Enable testing\n\n### Corrective Action Support\n- Assist in withdrawals and recalls\n- Inform distributors and deployers\n- Coordinate with non-EU provider\n\n## Serious Incident Reporting (Article 73)\n\nIf importer becomes aware of serious incident:\n- **Inform non-EU provider** immediately\n- **Inform market surveillance authority** without undue delay\n- **Report to AI Office** (if GPAI systemic risk)\n\n## Transformation into Provider (Article 23(7))\n\nImporter **becomes provider** (with full provider obligations) if:\n\n### Substantial Modification\n- Modifying AI system in a way that affects compliance\n- Altering intended purpose\n\n### Own Name/Trademark Placement\n- Placing under importer's name/trademark (not original provider's)\n\n**Consequence**: Full provider conformity assessment and compliance obligations\n\n## Liability and Penalties\n\n### Administrative Fines\nImporters face penalties for:\n- Placing non-compliant high-risk AI on market\n- Failing to verify compliance\n- Not cooperating with authorities\n\n**Maximum amounts**: Similar to provider penalties (proportionate to violation)\n\n### Product Liability\n- **Directive 85/374/EEC**: Importer treated as producer for defective products\n- **National tort law**: Negligence liability\n- **Proposed AI Liability Directive**: Fault-based liability for AI harm\n\n### Joint and Several Liability\nImporters may be jointly liable with providers for:\n- Defective AI systems\n- Fundamental rights violations\n- Safety incidents\n\n## Due Diligence Best Practices\n\n### Pre-Import Verification Checklist\n1. **Provider reputation**: Established, credible third-country provider\n2. **Compliance documentation**: Complete technical documentation review\n3. **Conformity assessment**: Verify notified body involvement (if required)\n4. **CE marking**: Authentic, properly affixed\n5. **Instructions**: Language and completeness cheque\n6. **Authorised representative**: Verify non-EU provider has EU representative OR importer assumes role\n\n### Contractual Protections\n- **Compliance warranties**: Provider warrants AI Act compliance\n- **Indemnification**: Provider indemnifies importer for non-compliance\n- **Documentation provision**: Obligation to supply all required documents\n- **Recall cooperation**: Procedures for corrective actions\n\n### Ongoing Monitoring\n- **Post-market surveillance**: Track performance and incidents\n- **Authority updates**: Stay informed on AI Act guidance\n- **Provider communication**: Regular compliance status cheques\n\n## Non-EU Provider Coordination\n\n### Authorised Representative Relationship\nIf non-EU provider has authorised representative (Article 22):\n- **Importer**: Focuses on placing and supply chain\n- **Authorised representative**: Handles authority liaison, compliance verification\n\n### No Authorised Representative\nIf provider lacks EU representative:\n- **Importer**: Assumes broader compliance verification role\n- **Responsibility**: Greater liability for ensuring provider compliance\n\n## Practical Scenarios\n\n### Scenario 1: US AI Software Importer\nEU company importing US-developed HR recruitment AI.\n\n**Obligations**:\n- Verify US provider completed conformity assessment\n- Ensure CE marking and EU Declaration of Conformity\n- Provide German/French instructions (target markets)\n- Maintain 10-year traceability records\n\n### Scenario 2: Multiple Third-Country Providers\nEU importer distributing AI from China, India, USA.\n\n**Risk management**:\n- Due diligence on each provider\n- Separate compliance verification per system\n- Comprehensive traceability by origin\n- Authority cooperation protocols\n\n### Scenario 3: Substantial Modification During Import\nImporter customises imported AI for EU market.\n\n**Consequence**: Becomes provider, requires new conformity assessment\n\n## Related Concepts\n\n- **Provider** (AI-0127): Primary duty-bearer\n- **Authorised Representative** (AI-0131): Non-EU provider's EU agent\n-
