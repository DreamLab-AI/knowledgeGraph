However, frameworks such as Hugging Face Transformers provide configurable parameters to set or extend sequence length within model-specific limits.\n\n## Technical Details\n\n- **Id**: maximum-sequence-length-ontology\n- **Collapsed**: true\n- **Source Domain**: ai\n- **Status**: draft\n- **Public Access**: true\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers and sources\n\t- Vaswani et al., 2017. \"Attention Is All You Need.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.
