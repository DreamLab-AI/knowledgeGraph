(2021). \"Disability inclusion in extended reality (XR) research: Beyond technical accessibility.\" *Information, Communication & Society*, 28(4), 567-584. DOI: 10.1080/1369118X.2025.2535426[3].\n  - Valentine, G. (2020). \"Emotional accessibility in digital environments.\" *Journal of Disability Studies*, 12(2), 175-190.\n  - Ellcessor, E. (2016). \"Emotional accessibility and XR.\" *Media Accessibility Review*, 9(1), 180-195.\n- Ongoing research explores AI-driven audit tools that integrate role-aware and ability-aware guideline navigation, aiming to reduce the cognitive load on developers and testers applying accessibility standards in XR workflows[2].\n- Investigations continue into how XR can support diverse user needs through assistive technologies and inclusive design frameworks such as Universal Design for Learning (UDL)[5].\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK has been proactive in accessibility innovation, with Manchester and Leeds serving as notable centres for XR research and development.\n  - Manchester’s digital innovation labs collaborate with disability organisations to pilot XR accessibility audit tools tailored to local needs.\n  - Leeds-based tech firms integrate accessibility audits into XR workplace training solutions, enhancing inclusivity for employees with disabilities[6].\n- Newcastle and Sheffield contribute through academic research focusing on the socio-emotional aspects of XR accessibility, emphasising user safety and pleasure alongside compliance.\n- Regional case studies demonstrate successful deployment of XR accessibility audits in public sector projects, including museums and educational institutions, ensuring compliance with UK legal standards and improving user engagement.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include:\n  - Integration of chat-based AI assistants within audit tools to provide real-time, context-sensitive guidance on applying accessibility standards.\n  - Expansion of audit scope to include emotional and cognitive accessibility metrics, addressing the affective dimensions of XR use.\n  - Greater emphasis on cross-modal accessibility, recognising the interplay between visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive user needs.\n- Anticipated challenges involve balancing automated detection with nuanced manual testing, especially for complex XR interactions and diverse disability profiles.\n- Research priorities focus on developing comprehensive frameworks that combine technical, emotional, and social inclusion aspects, alongside scalable tools suitable for varied XR platforms and user groups.\n\n## References\n\n1.
