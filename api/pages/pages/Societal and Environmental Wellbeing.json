Organisations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) promote wellbeing as a resource for resilient, sustainable communities, integrating health, social, economic, and environmental dimensions[2][6].\n  - In the UK, public health and environmental agencies incorporate wellbeing metrics into community planning and sustainability initiatives.\n  - Technical capabilities include sophisticated measurement tools for subjective wellbeing (OECD guidelines, 2025) and resource-use impact models that reveal nonlinear relationships between resource consumption and wellbeing[5][8].\n  - Limitations remain in operationalising wellbeing across diverse populations and balancing short-term needs with long-term sustainability[3].\n\n## Technical Details\n\n- **Id**: societalenvironmentalwellbeing-recent-developments\n- **Collapsed**: true\n- **Domain Prefix**: AI\n- **Sequence Number**: 0414\n- **Filename History**: [\"AI-0414-SocietalEnvironmentalWellbeing.md\"]\n- **Public Access**: true\n- **Source Domain**: ai\n- **Status**: in-progress\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-10-29\n- **Maturity**: mature\n- **Source**: [[UN SDGs]], [[Green AI]], [[IEA Data Centre Report]], [[EU AI Act]]\n- **Authority Score**: 0.95\n- **Owl:Class**: aigo:SocietalEnvironmentalWellbeing\n- **Owl:Physicality**: VirtualEntity\n- **Owl:Role**: Process\n- **Owl:Inferred Class**: aigo:VirtualProcess\n- **Belongstodomain**: [[AIEthicsDomain]]\n- **Implementedinlayer**: [[ConceptualLayer]]\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic contributions:\n  -
