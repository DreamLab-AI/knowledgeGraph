(1992). On Collective Memory. Chicago: University of Chicago Press\n\t- Assmann, A. (2011). Cultural Memory and Western Civilization: Functions, Media, Archives. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n\t- Collective memory archives are increasingly adopted by cultural institutions, community groups, and digital platforms to preserve and share local histories\n\t- Notable organisations and platforms include the British Library’s Community Archives, the National Archives’ digital collections, and the Digital Repository of Ireland\n\n- UK and North England examples where relevant\n\t- The Manchester Archives+ initiative brings together local libraries, museums, and community groups to create a shared repository of Manchester’s collective memory\n\t- Leeds City Council’s Local History Library and Archive supports community-led projects documenting the city’s industrial heritage\n\t- Newcastle’s Tyne & Wear Archives & Museums offer digital access to collections reflecting the region’s maritime and industrial past\n\t- Sheffield’s Local Studies Library curates materials on the city’s steel industry and social movements\n\n- Technical capabilities and limitations\n\t- Digital archives enable broad access and collaborative curation, but face challenges related to data preservation, metadata standards, and digital divide issues\n\t- Physical archives remain vital for preserving tangible heritage, but require ongoing maintenance and funding\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n\t- Archives adhere to international standards such as ISAD(G) and Dublin Core for metadata\n\t- The UK’s National Archives provide guidance on best practices for digital preservation and access\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers and sources\n\t- Halbwachs, M.
