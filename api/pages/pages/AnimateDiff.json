This module is trained on a large dataset of videos and learns to predict the motion between frames. When you provide AnimateDiff with an image and a text prompt, it uses the motion modelling module to generate a sequence of frames that create an animation.\n- ## Features\n\t- **Text-to-Video:** Generate animations from a text prompt and a static image.\n\t- **Image-to-Video:** Generate animations from a static image.\n\t- **Video-to-Video:** Transfer the style of one video to another.\n\t- **ControlNet:** Use ControlNet to guide the animation and create more complex movements.\n\t- **LoRA:** Use LoRA to fine-tune the model and create specific styles.\n- ## Resources\n\t- ### GitHub Repositories\n\t\t- [guoyww/animatediff](https://github.com/guoyww/animatediff) - A method for creating animation using diffusion models that introduces motion modules integrated into pre-trained text-to-image models, enabling flexible [[computer vision]] and [[machine learning]]-based video generation with customisable [[training]] and fine-tuning capabilities\n\t\t- [continue-revolution/sd-webui-animatediff](https://github.com/continue-revolution/sd-webui-animatediff) - Provides a straightforward method for incorporating AnimateDiff into Stable Diffusion web user interfaces, simplifying the generation of looping videos and animated GIFs with easy [[workflow management]], [[user experience]] optimisation, and [[documentation]] for [[troubleshooting]] common issues\n\t\t- [ArtVentureX/comfyui-animatediff](https://github.com/ArtVentureX/comfyui-animatediff) - Integrates the AnimateDiff motion module into ComfyUI's node-based interface, providing a visual workflow for creating animations with support for controlnets, LoRAs, and various Stable Diffusion checkpoints through [[software engineering]] best practices and [[community]] contributions\n\t- ### Tutorials\n\t\t- [Beginner Friendly AI Animation Tutorial #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPlUSnLTmfI) - Discusses strategies for effective time management and increased [[productivity]], covering prioritisation, the Pomodoro Technique, workspace [[organisation]], [[project management]] tools, and [[optimization]] techniques to prevent burnout\n\t\t- [AnimateDiff Tutorial for Automatic1111](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-zB4-gX3eA) - Summarises how to organise and manage digital photos effectively through folder structures, descriptive naming, metadata tagging, [[cloud computing]] backups, and [[knowledge management]] principles for maintaining a curated archive\n\t- ### Models and Examples\n\t\t- [Hugging Face - AnimateDiff](https://huggingface.co/guoyww/animatediff) - A framework designed to animate static images generated by text-to-image models, providing pre-trained motion modules, [[documentation]], and resources to lower the barrier to entry for creating animated content from text prompts with customisable artistic styles\n\t\t- [Civitai - AnimateDiff](https://civitai.com/models/372584/ipivs-morph-img2vid-animatediff-lcm-hyper-sd) - IPIVS Morph model designed to enhance image-to-video generation using Animatediff, LCM, and Hypernetworks for smoother transitions and improved aesthetic quality through [[automation]], [[optimization]], and [[machine learning]] techniques within the [[computer vision]] ecosystem\n- ## See Also\n\t- [[AI Video]] is a broad category encompassing techniques for generating, editing, and manipulating video content using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[deep learning]] methods\n\t- [[Stable Diffusion]] is a text-to-image [[deep learning]] model that uses diffusion processes to generate high-quality images from textual descriptions, serving as the foundation for many [[computer vision]] applications\n\t- [[ComfyUI]] is a node-based graphical interface for Stable Diffusion that enables visual workflow [[design thinking]] and simplified [[user experience]] for creating complex AI-generated imagery\n\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
