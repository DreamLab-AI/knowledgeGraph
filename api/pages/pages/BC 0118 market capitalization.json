Market capitalisation as a concept requires contextual framing around its definition, calculation methodology, applications, limitations, and theoretical foundations.\n\n## Next steps\n\nPlease provide:\n\n1. The existing BC-0118 ontology entry content\n2. Any specific academic or technical framework you're using (e.g., is this for financial ontologies, semantic web applications, or institutional knowledge management?)\n3. The intended audience and use case\n\nOnce you supply the current definition, I'll deliver a thoroughly revised entry in the exact format you've specified, incorporating current 2025 data, UK regional context, and appropriate academic rigour with a touch of wit where it naturally fits.\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-12\n- **Review Status**: Comprehensive editorial review\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable\n\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
