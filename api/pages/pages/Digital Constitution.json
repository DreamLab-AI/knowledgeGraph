This distinction is crucial for technical accuracy.\n\n## The Conceptual Problem\n\nYour definition describes a \"foundational governance document\" for \"metaverse communities and digital platforms\"—essentially a constitutional text for virtual societies. However, the academic literature indicates that **digital constitutionalism is not about creating new constitutional documents for digital spaces**. Rather, it concerns adapting existing constitutional principles and values to address governance challenges posed by digital technologies.[1][2][3]\n\nDigital constitutionalism addresses how traditional constitutional protections—freedom of expression, privacy, due process—apply when both state actors *and* private corporations (Meta, Google, etc.) exercise power over digital spaces.[3] It grapples with the fact that fundamental rights are now mediated by algorithmic systems and corporate policies, not merely government action.[3]\n\n## What Your Definition Actually Describes\n\nYour entry appears to describe something closer to a **\"digital bill of rights\"** or **\"platform constitution\"**—non-binding governance frameworks that civil society actors propose for cyberspace regulation.[4] These are real phenomena, but they're distinct from digital constitutionalism as an academic field.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nBefore I revise the ontology entry, you should clarify:\n\n1. **Are you defining \"digital constitutionalism\"** (the academic field examining how constitutional values adapt to digital governance)?\n2. **Or are you defining \"digital constitution\"** (a hypothetical or actual governance document for virtual communities)?\n\nThese require fundamentally different entries. The search results provide robust material for the former but limited guidance on the latter, which remains largely theoretical rather than established practice.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with revising the entry once you've clarified which concept you're documenting?\n\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-11\n- **Review Status**: Comprehensive editorial review\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable\n\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
