This comprehensive instrument provides shared values, principles, and actionable policy recommendations to ensure AI technologies respect human rights, protect human dignity, promote diversity and inclusion, and contribute to peaceful and just societies living in harmony with the environment. The Recommendation establishes four core values (human rights and dignity, living in peaceful just and interconnected societies, ensuring diversity and inclusiveness, environment and ecosystem flourishing) and ten foundational principles including proportionality, safety and security, fairness and non-discrimination, sustainability, right to privacy and data protection, human oversight and determination, transparency and explainability, responsibility and accountability, awareness and literacy, and multi-stakeholder and adaptive governance. Unlike legally binding treaties, UNESCO Recommendations establish normative standards that guide national legislation, institutional policies, and international cooperation, providing a foundation for ethical AI governance frameworks worldwide.\n\t- source:: [[UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI (2021)]]\n\t- maturity:: mature\n\t- owl:class:: aigo:UNESCORecommendationEthicsAI\n\t- owl:physicality:: VirtualEntity\n\t- owl:role:: Process\n\t- owl:inferred-class:: aigo:VirtualProcess\n\t- belongsToDomain:: [[AIEthicsDomain]]\n\t- implementedInLayer:: [[ConceptualLayer]]\n\n## UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI\n\nUNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI refers to the unesco recommendation on the ethics of artificial intelligence is the first global normative framework establishing ethical principles and policy actions for responsible ai development and deployment, adopted by unesco's 193 member states in november 2021. this comprehensive instrument provides shared values, principles, and actionable policy recommendations to ensure ai technologies respect human rights, protect human dignity, promote diversity and inclusion, and contribute to peaceful and just societies living in harmony with the environment. the recommendation establishes four core values (human rights and dignity, living in peaceful just and interconnected societies, ensuring diversity and inclusiveness, environment and ecosystem flourishing) and ten foundational principles including proportionality, safety and security, fairness and non-discrimination, sustainability, right to privacy and data protection, human oversight and determination, transparency and explainability, responsibility and accountability, awareness and literacy, and multi-stakeholder and adaptive governance. unlike legally binding treaties, unesco recommendations establish normative standards that guide national legislation, institutional policies, and international cooperation, providing a foundation for ethical ai governance frameworks worldwide.\n\n- The Recommendation has catalysed widespread adoption of ethical AI frameworks globally, with governments and organisations integrating its principles into national policies and AI project assessments.\n  - UNESCO’s AI Ethics Toolkit 2025 enhances implementation through tools like the AI Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM) and Ethical Impact Assessment (EIA), supporting governments in evaluating preparedness and mitigating harms[1][5].\n  - Notable implementations include public sector AI governance in countries such as Chile and Italy, demonstrating improved trust and project success.\n- In the UK, AI ethics frameworks increasingly reflect UNESCO’s standards, with public institutions and private sectors adopting transparency and fairness measures.\n  - Technical capabilities have advanced, yet challenges remain in addressing bias, explainability, and accountability in complex AI systems.\n- International standards and frameworks continue to evolve, with UNESCO fostering global collaboration via expert networks and forums, including the Global Forum on the Ethics of AI, promoting dialogue on gender equality, environmental protection, and non-discrimination[3][6].\n\n## Technical Details\n\n- **Id**: 0448-unescorecommendationethicsai-about\n- **Collapsed**: true\n- **Domain Prefix**: AI\n- **Sequence Number**: 0448\n- **Filename History**: [\"AI-0448-UNESCORecommendationEthicsAI.md\"]\n- **Public Access**: true\n- **Source Domain**: ai\n- **Status**: in-progress\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-10-29\n- **Maturity**: mature\n- **Source**: [[UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI (2021)]]\n- **Authority Score**: 0.98\n- **Owl:Class**: aigo:UNESCORecommendationEthicsAI\n- **Owl:Physicality**: VirtualEntity\n- **Owl:Role**: Process\n- **Owl:Inferred Class**: aigo:VirtualProcess\n- **Belongstodomain**: [[AIEthicsDomain]]\n- **Implementedinlayer**: [[ConceptualLayer]]\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic sources include:\n  - Jarke, J., & Bates, J.
