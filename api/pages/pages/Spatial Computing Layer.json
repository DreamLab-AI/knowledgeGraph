The updated entry emphasises the technical stack (edge computing, 5G, sensor fusion), distinguishes spatial computing from earlier VR paradigms, and acknowledges the current gap between interface capability and spatial medium potential—a rather amusing irony in a field ostensibly designed around spatial awareness. The UK context section identifies plausible innovation hubs; primary research would strengthen regional case studies considerably. All assertions reflect November 2025 knowledge and avoid time-sensitive announcements.\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-11\n- **Review Status**: Comprehensive editorial review\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
