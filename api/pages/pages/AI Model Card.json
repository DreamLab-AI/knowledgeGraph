Originally introduced by [[Google Research|Google researchers]] in 2019 (Mitchell et al., https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993), model cards have become a standard practice for documenting [[AI System|AI systems]], particularly in high-stakes domains. They serve as \"nutrition labels\" for AI models, offering stakeholders—including [[Developers]], [[Deployers]], [[Policymakers]], and [[End-Users]]—clear insights into a model's capabilities, limitations, and appropriate applications.\n\t- In [[Metaverse]] environments, where AI models power everything from [[Avatar Behaviour]] to [[Content Moderation]] and [[Personalized Experience|personalized experiences]], model cards are crucial for establishing [[Trust]], ensuring [[Ethical Deployment]], and maintaining [[Regulatory Compliance]] with emerging [[AI Governance]] frameworks. Similarly, in [[Blockchain]] and [[Cryptocurrency]] contexts, model cards document [[Bitcoin Trading Bot|trading algorithms]], [[Smart Contract Verification]] models, [[Fraud Detection System|fraud detection systems]], and [[Market Analysis]] AI, ensuring transparency and accountability in [[DeFi]] and [[Crypto Asset]] management.\n\t- ### Key Characteristics\n\t  id:: ai-model-card-characteristics\n\t\t- **Structured Format**: Follows standardised template ensuring consistent documentation across different models and organizations\n\t\t- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Documents model purpose, [[Model Architecture|architecture]], [[Training Data]], [[Performance]], [[Limitations]], and [[Ethical Considerations]]\n\t\t- **Transparency Focus**: Makes implicit model characteristics explicit to support [[Informed Decision-Making]]\n\t\t- **Stakeholder-Oriented**: Addresses information needs of multiple audiences from technical [[Developers]] to non-technical [[Decision-Makers]]\n\t\t- **Version Controlled**: Tracks changes to [[Model Documentation]] as models evolve and are updated\n\t\t- **Machine-Readable**: Often formatted (e.g., [[JSON]], [[YAML]], [[RDF]]) to support automated processing and integration with [[Model Registry|model registries]]\n\t\t- **Standards-Aligned**: Increasingly aligned with regulatory frameworks such as [[EU AI Act]] (https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/) and [[ISO/IEC 42001]] (https://www.iso.org/standard/81230.html)\n\t\t- **Domain-Specific Extensions**: Specialized model cards for [[Healthcare AI]] (CHAI), [[Financial Services]] (FCA), [[Cryptocurrency]] ([[Bitcoin]] trading, [[DeFi]] protocols), [[Autonomous Systems]]\n\t- ### Technical Components\n\t  id:: ai-model-card-components\n\t\t- [[Model Details]] -

Prior to their development, minimal standardised information accompanied machine learning models, creating significant risks for organisations attempting to assess suitability for specific applications\n  - The foundational motivation centred on promoting accountability and disclosure of essential model characteristics, including developer identity, intended use cases, performance across demographic groups, training data provenance, and ethical considerations\n  - This standardisation became particularly urgent following documented cases of algorithmic bias—such as discriminatory ad delivery systems—demonstrating how ostensibly neutral parameters could produce harmful outcomes for specific populations\n\n- Model cards function as structured documentation that bridges the gap between raw mathematical models and their real-world deployment contexts\n  - A model in isolation represents merely trained weights and mathematical operations; business value emerges only when embedded within complete AI systems comprising data pipelines, application logic, guardrails, monitoring infrastructure, and user interfaces\n  - Model cards provide the contextual scaffolding necessary for informed decision-making about model selection and integration\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and standardisation frameworks\n  - Model cards have evolved from research proposal to practical [[AI Governance]] tool, with mandatory requirements emerging in [[EU AI Act]] for high-risk systems\n  - The [[Coalition for Health AI]] (CHAI) (https://www.coalitionforhealthai.org/) developed the [[Applied Model Card]] specifically for healthcare use cases, embedding transparency requirements aligned with their Five Principles of [[Responsible AI]]: [[Usefulness]], [[Fairness]], [[Safety]], [[Transparency]], and [[Security & Privacy]]\n  - [[ISO/IEC 42001]] (https://www.iso.org/standard/81230.html) now incorporates model card structures within broader [[AI Management System]] documentation requirements, supporting transparency, [[Risk Management]], and continuous improvement protocols\n  - [[Red Hat]] (https://www.redhat.com/) and other enterprise platforms have formalised model card creation and management as standard practice, recognising their role in reducing integration risk and accelerating responsible adoption\n  - **2025 Crypto Adoption**: [[Coinbase]], [[Binance]], [[Kraken]] now require model cards for [[Algorithmic Trading]] systems; [[Uniswap]], [[Aave]], [[Compound]] publish cards for [[DeFi Protocol|protocol]] AI models\n  - [[Financial Conduct Authority]] (FCA) guidance on model cards for [[Bitcoin]] trading platforms and [[Crypto Asset]] firms (https://www.fca.org.uk/)\n\n- Technical capabilities and standardised content\n  - Model details: developer information, version history, architecture specifications, training algorithms, parameters, fairness constraints, and licencing terms\n  - Intended use: explicit delineation of in-scope applications and out-of-scope restrictions, with identified intended users\n  - Performance metrics: real-world impact assessment across relevant factors including demographic groups, environmental conditions, and technical attributes\n  - Training data documentation: provenance, statistical distribution characteristics, and dataset composition (though proprietary considerations may limit disclosure)\n  - Quantitative analysis: potential biases, failure modes, and performance limitations across use case boundaries\n  - Ethical considerations and recommendations: privacy implications, fairness concerns, individual and societal impacts, plus guidance for ongoing testing and monitoring\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - The [[National Health Service]] (NHS) (https://www.nhs.uk/) and UK health technology assessment bodies increasingly require model cards for AI systems undergoing procurement, particularly following regulatory alignment with [[Medical Device]] classification standards\n  - [[Manchester]], [[Leeds]], and [[Newcastle]] have emerged as significant AI research and development hubs, with academic institutions and technology firms adopting model card documentation as standard practice within their [[AI Governance]] frameworks\n  - The UK's approach to AI regulation, particularly through the [[AI Bill]] framework, emphasises [[Transparency Documentation]] compatible with model card structures, though formal mandates remain under development\n  - **North England Crypto Innovation**: [[Manchester]] [[Fintech]] sector requiring model cards for [[Bitcoin]] custody and trading AI; [[Edinburgh]] [[Blockchain]] hub adopting cards for [[Smart Contract]] verification models\n  - [[University of Manchester]], [[University of Leeds]], [[Newcastle University]] incorporating model card requirements in [[AI Research Ethics]] review processes\n  - [[FCA]] sandbox programmes in [[Manchester]] and [[Leeds]] testing model card frameworks for [[Crypto Asset]] AI applications\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Foundational academic work\n  -
