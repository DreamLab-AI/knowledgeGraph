This technique implements quantization through mapping continuous floating-point values to discrete integer levels using scale factor s and zero-point z with quantized value q = round(x/s) + z, supporting uniform quantization with evenly-spaced quantization levels and non-uniform quantization concentrating levels in high-density regions of value distributions. Quantization approaches include post-training quantization (PTQ) applying quantization to pre-trained models without retraining through calibration on representative dataset determining optimal scale/zero-point parameters (fast but may incur 1-3% accuracy loss), and quantization-aware training (QAT) simulating quantization during training through fake quantization operators enabling model to adapt learning quantization-friendly representations (slower but maintains accuracy within 0.5% of FP32 baseline). Quantization scope encompasses weight-only quantization maintaining FP32 activations reducing model size but limited speedup, weight and activation quantization enabling full integer inference pipeline achieving maximum speedup on INT8-capable hardware, and dynamic quantization determining activation scales at runtime balancing flexibility and performance.

**Post-Training Quantisation (PTQ)**: Applies quantisation to already-trained full-precision models using small calibration datasets. Offers computational efficiency and rapid deployment but typically yields lower accuracy than alternatives[1]\n  - **Quantisation-Aware Training (QAT)**: Incorporates quantisation effects during model training or fine-tuning. Requires additional computational overhead but substantially improves final model performance[1]\n- Industry adoption patterns and deployment contexts\n  - PTQ increasingly favoured for large language models where weight updates prove prohibitively expensive even with modern computational resources[1]\n  - QAT preferred for edge-oriented vision applications where models are prepared offline on servers, making the additional training overhead acceptable in exchange for improved accuracy[1]\n  - Hardware accelerators for edge deployment remain limited in supporting neural network training, reinforcing the QAT-on-servers, deployment-on-edge paradigm\n- Technical capabilities and current limitations\n  - Quantisation functions exhibit stair-like characteristics producing zero gradients, preventing direct application of traditional stochastic gradient descent methods[1]\n  - Backpropagation remains the critical challenge, addressed through two main categories: approximated gradient methods with exact gradients, and exact gradient methods with gradual quantisation[1]\n  - Performance degradation accompanies precision loss during floating-point to integer conversion, though modern techniques substantially mitigate this trade-off\n  - Recent advances include Qdrop, employing random weight suppression to mitigate activation quantisation distortion[4]\n- Quantisation strategies and frameworks\n  - Symmetric versus asymmetric approaches for parameter scaling[7]\n  - Uniform versus non-uniform quantisation methods for handling varied parameter distributions[7]\n  - Loss functions and metrics refined to achieve better fine-tuning during QAT processes[2]\n  - Vector quantisation methods preserving reconstruction quality of network outputs rather than individual weights[3]\n- UK and North England context\n  - Research institutions across the North actively contribute to quantisation methodology development, though specific institutional implementations remain dispersed across university computer science departments\n  - Industrial adoption concentrated in technology hubs, with Manchester and Leeds emerging as secondary centres for AI research infrastructure\n  - No dominant regional quantisation-specific research cluster currently established, though general deep learning research spans multiple Northern universities\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Foundational and contemporary sources\n  - Gholami et al.
