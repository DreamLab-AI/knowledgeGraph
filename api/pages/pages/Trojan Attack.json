UK context section acknowledges current information gaps rather than speculating. Academic references now include complete citations. The tone maintains technical rigour whilst remaining accessible—the observation that TensorFlow models function \"essentially as full programmes\" provides appropriate gravitas without unnecessary hedging. North England-specific examples remain absent from available literature, suggesting this may warrant targeted research if regional cybersecurity policy development is intended.\n\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-11\n- **Review Status**: Comprehensive editorial review\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
