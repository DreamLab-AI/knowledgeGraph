It encompasses all tangible and intangible elements that constitute or interact with blockchain systems, including data structures, cryptographic primitives, network participants, protocols, transactions, and governance mechanisms. This root class provides the taxonomic foundation for the entire blockchain ontology, establishing common properties and relationships inherited by all blockchain-related concepts. Blockchain entities share core characteristics of distributed operation, cryptographic security, and decentralized coordination, distinguishing them from traditional centralized computing constructs. The concept encompasses both technical artifacts (blocks, transactions, smart contracts) and organizational elements (nodes, validators, governance bodies), unified by their participation in blockchain-based trust and coordination mechanisms.\n\t- source:: [[ISO/IEC 23257:2021]], [[W3C Blockchain Community Group]], [[NIST Blockchain Technology Overview]]\n\t- maturity:: mature\n\t- owl:class:: bc:BlockchainEntity\n\t- owl:physicality:: ConceptualEntity\n\t- owl:role:: Concept\n\t- owl:inferred-class:: ConceptualConcept\n\t- belongsToDomain:: [[BlockchainDomain]]\n\t- implementedInLayer:: [[ConceptualLayer]]\n\n## Academic Context\n\n- Blockchain entities represent participants or organisations operating within blockchain networks, responsible for maintaining, validating, or utilising distributed ledger technology (DLT).\n  - The academic foundation of blockchain entities lies in computer science, cryptography, and distributed systems, with interdisciplinary links to law, economics, and organisational studies.\n  - Key developments include the conceptualisation of blockchain as a decentralised peer-to-peer network that achieves consensus despite failures or malicious actors, as outlined by Valiente and Tschorsch (2021)[6].\n  - Legal scholarship emphasises the necessity for blockchain entities to align with existing regulatory frameworks, particularly regarding transaction enforceability and data protection laws such as the EU’s GDPR[1][4].\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Blockchain entities today encompass a broad spectrum of actors, including miners, validators, node operators, developers, and end-users, each fulfilling distinct roles within blockchain ecosystems.\n  - Industry adoption spans finance, supply chain, healthcare, media, and energy sectors, with blockchain entities facilitating transparency, security, and automation through smart contracts and tokenisation[7].\n  - Notable platforms include Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and Corda, which support diverse blockchain entities from public to permissioned networks.\n  - In the UK, and particularly in North England, blockchain entities are increasingly embedded in innovation hubs such as Manchester’s Digital Futures, Leeds’ FinTech sector, and Newcastle’s blockchain research initiatives, fostering regional adoption and development.\n- Technical capabilities of blockchain entities include decentralised consensus, immutability, cryptographic security, and interoperability; however, limitations persist in scalability, energy consumption, and regulatory compliance[1][7].\n- Standards and frameworks guiding blockchain entities are evolving, with organisations like the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the UK’s Centre for Digital Trust providing governance models and best practices.\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic contributions include:\n  - Valiente, M.-C., & Tschorsch, F.
