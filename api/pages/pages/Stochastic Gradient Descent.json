(2025). \"Limit Theorems for Stochastic Gradient Descent in High-Dimensional Single-Layer Networks.\" *arXiv* preprint 2511.02258.

The field remains active, with particular momentum in theoretical understanding of high-dimensional dynamics and practical applications in distributed systems and scientific computing.\n\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-11\n- **Review Status**: Comprehensive editorial review\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
