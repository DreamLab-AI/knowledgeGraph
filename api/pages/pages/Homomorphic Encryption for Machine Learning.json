This approach implements encryption schemes where operations on encrypted data produce encrypted results that, when decrypted, match results of operations on plaintext, formalized as Decrypt(Encrypt(m1) ⊕ Encrypt(m2)) = m1 + m2 for addition and Decrypt(Encrypt(m1) ⊗ Encrypt(m2)) = m1 × m2 for multiplication. Scheme types include partially homomorphic encryption supporting only addition (Paillier) or only multiplication (RSA), somewhat homomorphic encryption permitting limited operations before noise accumulation requires decryption, and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enabling arbitrary computations on encrypted data through bootstrapping refreshing ciphertexts to control noise growth, implemented in schemes like BGV, BFV for integer arithmetic, and CKKS for approximate arithmetic on real/complex numbers suitable for machine learning. ML applications include encrypted inference where clients encrypt inputs, servers perform encrypted prediction, and clients decrypt results without server seeing plaintext data, federated learning with clients encrypting model updates before aggregation preventing coordinator privacy breaches, and collaborative training enabling multiple parties to jointly train models on combined encrypted datasets without exposing individual contributions. The 2024-2025 period witnessed homomorphic encryption mature sufficiently for commercial deployment with Microsoft's SEAL library and IBM's HELib enabling encrypted computation, Intel SGX and ARM TrustZone providing hardware-backed confidential computing, and sectors including healthcare, finance, and government adopting PPML for regulatory-compliant training on sensitive data, though substantial challenges remained including 10-100x computational overhead compared to plaintext operations, complexity of parameter selection balancing security and performance, and limited operation support with neural network architectures requiring approximations.\n    -

The concept emerged as a decades-long pursuit culminating in Craig Gentry's 2009 proof of concept whilst at Stanford University and IBM[4]\n  - Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) now enables processing of data whilst under cryptographic lock and key, albeit without modification of the underlying dataset[4]\n  - The field has matured from theoretical construct to practical implementation, addressing the \"Holy Grail\" problem of privacy-preserving computation[4]\n\n- Current state represents a convergence of cryptographic theory with machine learning infrastructure\n  - Hardware acceleration has transformed computational feasibility from theoretical to practical[1]\n  - Privacy-enhancing technology (PET) frameworks now position FHE as approaching mainstream adoption in 2025[2]\n  - Integration with federated learning architectures enables secure collaborative AI without exposing raw data[1]\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - AI and blockchain sectors lead early adoption, driven by unprecedented third-party computation requirements and privacy regulation compliance needs[2]\n  - Apple has implemented the Brakerski-Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) HE scheme for machine learning workflows, achieving post-quantum 128-bit security suitable for embedding vector operations and similarity computations[6]\n  - Healthcare sector increasingly leverages HE for secure collaboration across organisations, enabling comprehensive datasets for AI model training whilst maintaining HIPAA and GDPR compliance[5]\n  - GPU-accelerated implementations achieved 267× speed improvements over CPU baselines (ResNet-20 inference in 8.5 seconds), with further optimisation to 1.4 seconds through polynomial approximation of ReLU activations[1]\n  - FPGA-based accelerators demonstrated 370× performance gains over baseline CPUs for logistic regression training on substantial datasets (11,982 samples, 196 features)[1]\n\n- Technical capabilities and limitations\n  - Selective parameter encryption focuses computational resources on sensitive parameters, achieving 3× speed improvements by using sensitivity maps to identify critical model components[1]\n  - Optimised ciphertext packing and batch operations bundle multiple parameters into single ciphertexts, incorporating differential privacy noise directly into encrypted data to reduce homomorphic operation overhead[1]\n  - Hybrid homomorphic encryption (HHE) architectures combine symmetric encryption with FHE to balance client-side and server-side computational burden, particularly valuable for edge device deployment[3]\n  - Hardware-accelerated HHE implementations on FPGA platforms (PYNQ-Z2) demonstrated over 50× reduction in client-side encryption latency and nearly 2× throughput gains compared to existing accelerators[3]\n  - Remaining challenges include high computational costs, key management complexity, and communication overhead, though ongoing research continues addressing these constraints[1]\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - FHETCH consortium represents cross-industry standardisation effort driving FHE adoption through collaborative development[2]\n  - Private information retrieval (PIR) and private nearest neighbour search (PNNS) frameworks enable practical applications combining HE with machine learning workflows[6]\n  - Post-quantum security parameters (128-bit) now standard in production implementations, anticipating future quantum computing threats[6]\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers and sources\n  -
