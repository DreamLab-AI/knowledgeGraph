quality, and implement appropriate access controls throughout data collection, processing, storage, and sharing activities. this dimension encompasses four core components: privacy protection (implementing data minimization collecting only necessary information, purpose limitation ensuring data used only for specified purposes, privacy by design embedding privacy safeguards into system architecture from inception, and privacy by default configuring systems to maximum privacy protection without user intervention), data quality (ensuring accuracy of data reflecting current reality,

role-based access restricting data access to authorised personnel with legitimate need, enforcing need-to-know principles limiting information exposure, maintaining comprehensive audit trails documenting all data access and modifications, and protecting against unauthorized access through authentication and authorization mechanisms), and data governance framework (documenting data provenance tracking origin and collection methods, maintaining data lineage showing transformations and derivations, conducting data protection impact assessments for high-risk processing per gdpr article 35, and ensuring gdpr compliance including lawful basis, consent management, and data subject rights). the eu ai act integrates seamlessly with gdpr requirements establishing that ai systems

governance frameworks to meet regulatory requirements and enhance data-driven decision-making\n\t- Notable organisations and platforms\n\t\t- NHS Digital in the UK continues to lead in health data governance, with regional hubs in Manchester and Leeds supporting local data initiatives\n\t\t- The Alan Turing Institute in London and Newcastle’s Data Science Campus collaborate on national data governance research\n\t\t- UK and North England examples where relevant\n\t\t\t- Manchester’s Health Innovation Manchester coordinates regional health data governance, fostering collaboration between NHS trusts, universities, and local authorities\n\t\t\t- Leeds City Council’s data governance programme supports smart city initiatives, integrating data from transport, housing, and public services\n\t\t\t- Newcastle’s Urban Observatory uses real-time data governance to monitor and improve urban environments\n\t\t\t- Sheffield’s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) applies
