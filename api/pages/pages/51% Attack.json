Some of theseconsiderations and features are:\n\t\t\t\t- The system must be open and permissionless, not a cabal of authorities who can exclude and remove participants.\n\t\t\t\t- The system must be well-tested, and proven secure against attack over a long enough duration to be confident in.\n\t\t\t\t- The system must produce a singular, independently verifiable record that is as immutable as possible, so that reversing the record the system produces is infeasible.\n\t\t\t\t- The system must be widely deployed, with nodes that span the globe, to ensure the record is persisted.\n\t\t\t\t- The system must be self-incentivized, so that nodes continue to operate, process, and secure the record over time. The value from operation must come from the system directly, because outside incentive reliance is itself a vector for attack.\n\t\t\t\t- The cost to attack the system through any game theoretically available means must be high enough that it is infeasible to attempt, and even if an ultra-capitalized attacker did, it would require a weaponized mobilization of force and resources that would be obvious, with options for mitigation.\n\t\t\t\t- The outcome:\n\t\t\t\t\t- Number 1 eliminates private and permissioned ledgers\n\t\t\t\t\t- Number 2 eliminates just about all other ledgers and blockchains, simply because they are inadequately tested\n\t\t\t\t\t- For the metrics detailed in 3-6, Bitcoin is so far beyond all other options, it isn’t even close\n\t\t- Bitcoin is the most secure option by an absurdly large margin.”\n\t\t- On the surface then it might seem that the choice is Bitcoin again, and indeed that the open source Microsoft ION stack is a natural choice, but it’s complex to run, the interactions with the blockchain have a cost implication which can’t be surmounted without every user owning some Bitcoin, and as we have seen, there is no formal validation of this system. In addition (in the current implementation) an identity proof does not need to be published to be valid, just timestamped. In this way an identity can be stolen and used years later to claim later chains of proof. It seems that it might be somewhat useful ‘at scale’ and is worth additional monitoring and investigation, especially given it’s integration into TBD\n\t\t- Web5.\n\n\t- ##### Webs of trust\n\t\t- Webs of trust will be built within worlds using economically costly (but\n\t\t  private) social rating systems, between any actor, human or AI. It\n\t\t  should be too costly to attack an individual aggressively. This implies\n\t\t  an increased weighting for scores issued in short time periods. Poorly\n\t\t  behaving AI’s will eventually be excluded through lack of funds.\n\n\t- ### Enhancing Cybersecurity Measures\n\t\t- Given the evolving threat landscape, enhancing cybersecurity measures is imperative:\n\t\t\t- **Infrastructure Vulnerabilities**: The CrowdStrike incident highlights the vulnerabilities in digital infrastructure and the need for robust cybersecurity practices ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/global-cyber-outage-grounds-flights-hits-media-financial-telecoms-2024-07-19/)).\n\t\t\t- **Dependency on Technology Providers**: Reevaluating dependencies on specific providers and adopting more resilient design principles can mitigate the risks of large-scale outages ([Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/20/slow-recovery-after-crowdstrike-update-sparks-global-it-outage)).\n- [Open Generative AI tools](https://github.com/AbdBarho/stable-diffusion-webui-docker)\n\t- - [[]]The GitHub repository \"AbdBarho/stable-diffusion-webui-docker\" offers an easy Docker setup for Stable Diffusion, featuring a user-friendly UI.\n\t- Users can run Stable Diffusion on their machines with a nice UI without hassle.\n\t- The repository provides multiple UI options for stable diffusion, including AUTOMATIC1111 and ComfyUI.\n\t- Contributions to the project are welcome after creating a discussion about the problem and proposed contribution.\n\t- The authors disclaim responsibility for any content generated using the interface, outlining restrictions in the license.\n\t- Special thanks are extended to contributors of projects like AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui and Sygil-webui.\n\t- The project is based on topics like Docker, PyTorch, Gradio, Docker-compose, and Stable Diffusion.\n- [Adversarial Machine Learning: A Taxonomy and Terminology of Attacks and Mitigations](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/ai/100/2/e2023/final)\n\t- [[]]The web page discusses the NIST Trustworthy and Responsible AI report on adversarial machine learning (AML).

Some of theseconsiderations and features are:\n\t\t\t\t- The system must be open and permissionless, not a cabal of authorities who can exclude and remove participants.\n\t\t\t\t- The system must be well-tested, and proven secure against attack over a long enough duration to be confident in.\n\t\t\t\t- The system must produce a singular, independently verifiable record that is as immutable as possible, so that reversing the record the system produces is infeasible.\n\t\t\t\t- The system must be widely deployed, with nodes that span the globe, to ensure the record is persisted.\n\t\t\t\t- The system must be self-incentivized, so that nodes continue to operate, process, and secure the record over time. The value from operation must come from the system directly, because outside incentive reliance is itself a vector for attack.\n\t\t\t\t- The cost to attack the system through any game theoretically available means must be high enough that it is infeasible to attempt, and even if an ultra-capitalized attacker did, it would require a weaponized mobilization of force and resources that would be obvious, with options for mitigation.\n\t\t\t\t- The outcome:\n\t\t\t\t\t- Number 1 eliminates private and permissioned ledgers\n\t\t\t\t\t- Number 2 eliminates just about all other ledgers and blockchains, simply because they are inadequately tested\n\t\t\t\t\t- For the metrics detailed in 3-6, Bitcoin is so far beyond all other options, it isn’t even close\n\t\t- Bitcoin is the most secure option by an absurdly large margin.”\n\t\t- On the surface then it might seem that the choice is Bitcoin again, and indeed that the open source Microsoft ION stack is a natural choice, but it’s complex to run, the interactions with the blockchain have a cost implication which can’t be surmounted without every user owning some Bitcoin, and as we have seen, there is no formal validation of this system. In addition (in the current implementation) an identity proof does not need to be published to be valid, just timestamped. In this way an identity can be stolen and used years later to claim later chains of proof. It seems that it might be somewhat useful ‘at scale’ and is worth additional monitoring and investigation, especially given it’s integration into TBD\n\t\t- Web5.\n\n\t- ##### Webs of trust\n\t\t- Webs of trust will be built within worlds using economically costly (but\n\t\t  private) social rating systems, between any actor, human or AI. It\n\t\t  should be too costly to attack an individual aggressively. This implies\n\t\t  an increased weighting for scores issued in short time periods. Poorly\n\t\t  behaving AI’s will eventually be excluded through lack of funds.\n\n- ## Misinformation vs Disinformation\n\t- In Barb McQuade's book, [*Attack from Within: How Disinformation is Sabotaging America*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150065063-attack-from-within), the author explores the pernicious effects of disinformation and its deliberate use to deceive and manipulate the public. This phenomenon, which McQuade distinguishes from the unwitting spread of false information or misinformation, is particularly potent in our digital age where social media amplifies and accelerates the dissemination of falsehoods[1].\n\t- McQuade illustrates how disinformation works through a variety of tactics employed by authoritarians throughout history, including Hitler and Mussolini. These tactics, which have been modernised by figures like Steve Bannon and Donald Trump, include promoting a sense of national decline (declinism), exploiting societal fears, demonising and scapegoating specific groups, manipulating emotions over reason, and normalising violence. These methods are used to create a divided society where people are more likely to [choose their political tribe over the truth](https://www.sevenstories.com/books/4577-attack-from-within).\n\t- The stakes of disinformation are immense, impacting democracy, the environment, and public safety. Voter suppression laws and a growing distrust in institutions are direct results of sustained disinformation campaigns. In the US, these issues are mirrored in the increasing polarisation and partisanship that make effective governance difficult.\n\t- To combat this, McQuade suggests both governmental and personal actions. Governmental actions include regulating social media algorithms to prevent the promotion of sensationalist content and implementing campaign finance reforms to reduce the influence of dark money in politics. On a personal level, improving media literacy and prioritising truth over tribalism are crucial. Educating individuals to critically evaluate information and fostering a culture of scepticism and inquiry are essential steps in this direction.\n\t- The recent race riots in the United Kingdom during August 2024 serve as a stark example of the dangers McQuade outlines. Triggered by the tragic stabbing of three young girls in Southport and fuelled by [Russian misinformation](https://insightnews.media/disinformation-spreader-that-fueled-violence-in-the-uk-allegedly-has-russian-traces/) suggesting the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker, the riots spread rapidly across various UK cities. Social media platforms like Facebook, Telegram, and WhatsApp were instrumental in spreading these false claims and coordinating protests and violent actions. Far-right figures, including Tommy Robinson, amplified these false narratives, leading to widespread unrest and violence, including attacks on mosques and asylum seeker accommodations.\n\t- The UK government responded with significant law enforcement measures, making over 400 arrests and considering terrorism charges against some suspects. The situation [highlighted the role of social media](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/05/nx-s1-5063345/misinformation-online-fueled-all-out-race-riots-in-the-united-kingdom) in creating a permissive environment for violence and herd mentality, as well as the difficulties authorities face in curbing the spread of misinformation.\n\n- ## Misinformation vs Disinformation\n\t- In Barb McQuade's book, [*Attack from Within: How Disinformation is Sabotaging America*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150065063-attack-from-within), the author explores the pernicious effects of disinformation and its deliberate use to deceive and manipulate the public.
