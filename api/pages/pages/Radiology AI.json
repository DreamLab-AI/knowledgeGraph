(2024). \"The Future of Radiology: AI's Transformative Role in Medical Imaging.\" RSNA 2024 Plenary Session. Emphasis on human-machine collaboration and the principle that machine intelligence is different, not better than human intelligence[5]\n  - Recent literature (2025) emphasises AI agents in radiology toward autonomous and adaptive intelligence, with applications in administrative automation, image analysis, and structured reporting[3]\n  - PMC review (2025): \"Navigating the AI revolution: will radiology sink or soar?\" Comprehensive analysis of opportunities, barriers, and the necessity of radiologist oversight in maintaining clinical governance[4]\n- Ongoing research directions\n  - Development of transparent, explainable AI systems addressing current concerns about algorithmic opacity[5]\n  - Expansion of foundation models capable of multimodal analysis linking imaging with clinical text and patient data[2]\n  - Investigation of fair and representative AI model design through diverse interdisciplinary teams[5]\n  - Research into workload redistribution and professional identity preservation as AI assumes routine tasks[4]\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends and anticipated developments\n  - Autonomous AI agents capable of orchestrating complex clinical workflows whilst preserving final decision-making authority with radiologists[3]\n  - Increased personalisation of screening and diagnostic models tailored to individual patient risk profiles[2]\n  - Borderless collaboration enabled by global data networks and AI-powered platforms, allowing radiologists to focus on complex decision-making and patient interaction[4]\n  - Integration of AI education into medical training curricula to ensure incoming radiologists possess requisite competencies[4]\n- Anticipated challenges and research priorities\n  - Establishing robust frameworks for transparency and explainability, particularly for high-stakes diagnostic decisions[4][5]\n  - Resolving liability and reimbursement models that fairly compensate radiologists whilst incentivising AI adoption[4]\n  - Ensuring equitable access to AI tools across diverse healthcare settings, preventing widening of diagnostic capability gaps[5]\n  - Maintaining radiologist clinical oversight and professional autonomy as systems become increasingly autonomous—a matter of both governance and professional identity[4]\n  - Addressing data accessibility and diversity to ensure AI models perform equitably across populations and imaging protocols[5]\n\n## References\n\n[1] AMN Healthcare.
