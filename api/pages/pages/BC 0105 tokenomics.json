I shall then apply the rigorous, UK-English, technically precise approach you've specified, complete with appropriate citations and Logseq formatting.\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-12\n- **Review Status**: Comprehensive editorial review\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
