Organization (DAO) refers to autonomous governance entity operating through rules encoded in smart contracts, enabling collective decision-making, treasury management, and organizational operations without centralized authority.\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n\t- DAOs are widely used in decentralised finance (DeFi), NFT projects, and community-driven initiatives\n\t- Notable organisations and platforms include Uniswap, Synthetix, and MakerDAO, which have established robust governance models and large member bases\n\t- In the UK, DAOs are gaining traction in fintech, creative industries, and social enterprises, with several projects emerging from Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield\n- UK and North England examples where relevant\n\t- Manchester-based DAOs are active in the fintech and blockchain sectors, leveraging the city's strong tech ecosystem\n\t- Leeds has seen the rise of DAOs focused on community development and local innovation, often collaborating with universities and local authorities\n\t- Newcastle and Sheffield are home to DAOs exploring applications in digital art, education, and social impact, benefiting from regional innovation hubs and supportive local policies\n- Technical capabilities and limitations\n\t- DAOs offer transparent, automated governance through smart contracts, enabling efficient decision-making and resource allocation\n\t- Limitations include scalability issues, regulatory uncertainty, and the potential for governance attacks or centralisation of voting power\n- Standards and frameworks\n\t- Industry standards for DAO governance are still evolving, with ongoing efforts to establish best practices for transparency, security, and member participation\n\t- Frameworks such as the DAOstack and Aragon are widely used to facilitate the creation and management of DAOs\n\n## Technical Details\n\n- **Id**: dao-related\n- **Collapsed**: true\n- **Source Domain**: metaverse\n- **Status**: draft\n-
