Physics engines continue functioning as real-time simulators of physical interactions; no fundamental paradigm shifts have occurred since 2024. The field is consolidating around GPU acceleration and open-source solutions rather than experiencing revolutionary change—rather like watching a well-tuned engine run smoothly, which is precisely what one hopes for in production systems.\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-11\n- **Review Status**: Comprehensive editorial review\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
