Stablecoins (USDC, DAI) pegged to USD avoid cryptocurrency volatility, whilst Lightning Network enables sub-penny transaction fees for microtask payments.\n\n## Advantages\n\n- **Instant Settlement**: Payments confirmed in seconds-minutes\n- **Low Fees**: <£0.01 vs. 3-5% PayPal/wire transfer fees\n- **Global Access**: Anyone with internet can receive payments\n- **Financial Inclusion**: Enables unbanked populations to participate in remote work\n\n## Challenges\n\n- **Volatility**: Bitcoin, Ethereum prices fluctuate (stablecoins mitigate this)\n- **Tax Complexity**: Cryptocurrency income/capital gains taxation complicated (HMRC guidance)\n- **Regulatory Risk**: Some jurisdictions restrict cryptocurrency use\n- **User Experience**: Requires cryptocurrency wallet literacy\n\n## UK Tax Treatment (HMRC)\n\n- Cryptocurrency payments subject to income tax, National Insurance\n- Capital gains tax applies to token appreciation (£3,000 annual exemption, 2025)\n- Employers paying in crypto must withhold PAYE, NI\n\n## Related Concepts\n\n- [[TELE-002-telecollaboration]]\n- [[TELE-250-blockchain-collaboration]]\n- [[TELE-251-smart-contract-coordination]]\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Term-ID**: TELE-253\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Maturity**: Developing\n- **Authority Score**: 0.77",
