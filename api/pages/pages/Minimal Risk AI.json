(2023). *A Unified Framework of AI Risk and Governance*. Journal of AI Ethics, 7(2), 123-145. DOI:10.1007/s43681-023-00015-4\n  - European Commission (2024). *The Artificial Intelligence Act: Risk-Based Approach to AI Regulation*. Official EU Publication. URL: digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu\n  - Ryan, M., & Smith, A. (2025). *Regulating AI: Balancing Innovation and Safety*. AI & Society, 40(1), 89-105. DOI:10.1007/s00146-024-01567-9\n- Ongoing research focuses on refining risk assessment methodologies, improving transparency in AI deployment, and exploring the socio-technical implications of minimal risk AI systems.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK government adopts a pragmatic stance on Minimal Risk AI, emphasising innovation-friendly policies while encouraging responsible AI use.\n  - The UK AI Strategy (2024) highlights support for AI applications with low risk profiles to accelerate adoption in sectors such as gaming, retail, and public services.\n- North England hosts several innovation hubs fostering Minimal Risk AI development and deployment:\n  - Manchester’s AI Foundry supports startups creating AI tools for non-critical applications.\n  - Leeds Digital Hub promotes AI in retail and logistics, often utilising minimal risk AI systems.\n  - Newcastle and Sheffield universities contribute research on AI ethics and governance frameworks applicable to low-risk AI.\n- Regional case studies demonstrate successful integration of Minimal Risk AI in customer service automation and supply chain optimisation without regulatory complications.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include:\n  - Increased voluntary adoption of ethical AI codes and transparency measures by providers of Minimal Risk AI to build user trust.\n  - Expansion of Minimal Risk AI into new domains such as personalised education tools and non-critical healthcare support.\n- Anticipated challenges involve:\n  - Ensuring that Minimal Risk AI systems do not inadvertently escalate into higher risk through evolving functionalities.\n  - Maintaining vigilance against misuse or unintended consequences despite the absence of strict regulation.\n- Research priorities focus on:\n  - Developing dynamic risk assessment tools that can adapt as AI systems evolve.\n  - Enhancing user awareness and informed consent mechanisms even for minimal risk applications.\n\n## References\n\n1.
