(2024). \"Resolution Planning and Financial Stability: A Regulatory Perspective.\" *Journal of Financial Regulation*, 10(2), 123-145. DOI:10.1093/jfr/fraa045\n  - European Banking Authority (2025). *EBA Methodological Guide on Risk Indicators and Reporting*. EBA Publications. Available at: [EBA website]\n  - Single Resolution Board (2025). *SRB Taxonomy Extension for Resolution Reporting*. SRB Reports.\n- Ongoing research focuses on improving resolution plan effectiveness, cross-border coordination, and enhancing data taxonomy for better supervisory analytics.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- British contributions include the Bank of England’s active role in resolution planning frameworks and collaboration with the PRA to ensure UK banks meet international standards.\n- North England innovation hubs such as Manchester and Newcastle are increasingly involved in regulatory technology (RegTech) solutions that facilitate compliance with resolution reporting requirements.\n- Regional case studies highlight fintech firms in Leeds developing XBRL reporting tools that assist mid-sized banks in meeting SRB and EBA taxonomy requirements, demonstrating a practical application of rb 0036 resolution standards outside London.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include greater automation in resolution data reporting, enhanced use of artificial intelligence for risk assessment, and increased focus on climate-related financial risks within resolution planning.\n- Anticipated challenges involve harmonising resolution frameworks post-Brexit, managing data privacy concerns, and addressing the complexity of global banking groups’ resolution strategies.\n- Research priorities emphasise cross-jurisdictional cooperation, improving data validation techniques, and integrating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into resolution planning.\n\n## References\n\n1.
