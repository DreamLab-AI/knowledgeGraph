Solutions, Benefits & Challenges.\" Provides a technical overview of custody methods and security technologies.\n  - Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP (2025). \"SEC Staff Provides Guidance on Crypto Custody.\" Details regulatory developments affecting custody providers.\n  - Société Générale Securities Services (2025). \"Blockchain and Custody: Towards a Complete Review of Custody Models.\" Discusses custody modes for blockchain assets and legal implications.\n- Ongoing research focuses on:\n  - Enhancing cryptographic security methods, including MPC and threshold signatures.\n  - Legal frameworks for custody of tokenised RWAs, especially in cross-jurisdictional contexts.\n  - Integration of custody services with DeFi protocols and programmable finance.\n  - Balancing decentralisation ideals with institutional custody requirements.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK has seen significant advancements in digital asset custody, with financial centres like London leading regulatory and technological innovation.\n- North England hubs such as Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield are emerging as innovation centres, hosting fintech startups and custodial service providers focusing on blockchain security and compliance.\n- British custodians increasingly align with FCA regulations and collaborate with traditional banks to offer hybrid custody solutions combining cold storage and regulated trust frameworks.\n- Regional case studies include Manchester-based fintech firms pioneering secure custody solutions tailored for institutional clients, leveraging local expertise in cybersecurity and financial services.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends:\n  - Greater integration of custody services with DeFi and programmable finance, enabling automated asset management and governance.\n  - Expansion of custody solutions for tokenised real-world assets, including real estate, equities, and bonds.\n  - Adoption of advanced cryptographic techniques to improve security without sacrificing operational flexibility.\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Navigating evolving regulatory landscapes, particularly regarding cross-border custody and asset classification.\n  - Ensuring interoperability between custody platforms and diverse blockchain ecosystems.\n  - Mitigating operational risks while maintaining user-friendly access to assets.\n- Research priorities:\n  - Developing standardised legal and technical frameworks for custody of tokenised assets.\n  - Enhancing resilience against cyber threats through innovative cryptographic protocols.\n  - Exploring the socio-economic impact of custody models on decentralisation and financial inclusion.\n\n## References\n\n1.
