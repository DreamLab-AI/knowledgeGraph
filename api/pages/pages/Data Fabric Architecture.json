DOI:10.1016/j.dsr.2024.04.003\n- Ongoing research focuses on enhancing AI-driven metadata management, improving interoperability with legacy systems, and developing adaptive policy frameworks for data governance.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK has seen significant contributions to data fabric research and implementation, particularly in public sector data integration and financial services.\n- North England innovation hubs such as Manchester’s MediaCityUK and Leeds Digital Hub foster collaborations between academia and industry to advance data fabric technologies.\n- Regional case studies:\n  - A Sheffield-based manufacturing consortium implemented a data fabric to integrate supply chain data, improving operational efficiency and compliance with UK export regulations.\n  - Newcastle’s healthcare trusts have adopted data fabric architectures to unify patient records across multiple hospital systems, enhancing care coordination and data security.\n- UK-specific challenges include compliance with the UK GDPR post-Brexit and ensuring data sovereignty within hybrid cloud deployments.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends:\n  - Greater integration of AI and machine learning for proactive data governance and anomaly detection.\n  - Expansion of data fabric capabilities to support edge computing and IoT data streams in real time.\n  - Development of standardised interoperability protocols to ease integration with legacy and third-party systems.\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Balancing data accessibility with stringent privacy and security requirements.\n  - Managing the complexity of multi-cloud and hybrid environments without escalating costs.\n  - Ensuring user-friendly self-service access while maintaining robust governance.\n- Research priorities include:\n  - Enhancing metadata intelligence for dynamic data lineage and impact analysis.\n  - Creating adaptive policy engines that respond to evolving regulatory landscapes.\n  - Investigating the socio-technical aspects of data fabric adoption in organisational contexts.\n\n## References\n\n1.
