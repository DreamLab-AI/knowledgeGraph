This holistic concept encompasses physical health, mental health, social connections, meaningful work, and overall quality of life.\n\n## Key Characteristics\n\n- **Holistic perspective**: Addressing multiple dimensions of human flourishing\n- **Quality of life**: Enhancing lived experience beyond economic measures\n- **Health support**: Contributing to physical and mental health\n- **Social connection**: Strengthening rather than replacing human relationships\n- **Meaningful engagement**: Enabling purposeful work and activities\n\n## Relationships\n\n- **Parent Concept**: OECD AI Principle 1 (Inclusive Growth, Sustainable Development and Well-Being)\n- **Related Terms**:\n  - Inclusive Growth (AI-0156)\n  - Sustainable Development (AI-0157)\n  - Human-Centred Values (AI-0159)\n  - Social Impact (AI-0170)\n- **Measured By**: Well-being metrics, quality of life indicators, health outcomes\n\n## Well-Being Dimensions\n\n### Physical Health\n- Healthcare accessibility and quality improvements\n- Disease detection and prevention\n- Assistive technologies for disability\n- Environmental health monitoring\n\n### Mental Health\n- Psychological support systems\n- Stress and anxiety management\n- Prevention of algorithmic harm\n- Digital well-being protection\n\n### Social Well-Being\n- Community strengthening\n- Reduced social isolation\n- Enhanced communication capabilities\n- Maintained human agency in relationships\n\n### Economic Well-Being\n- Meaningful employment opportunities\n- Income security and stability\n- Work-life balance support\n- Skill development pathways\n\n### Civic Well-Being\n- Democratic participation enhancement\n- Access to information and services\n- Community engagement support\n- Rights protection and empowerment\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\n1. **Impact assessment**: Evaluating effects on multiple well-being dimensions\n2. **Harm prevention**: Avoiding psychological manipulation and exploitation\n3. **Autonomy preservation**: Maintaining human agency and self-determination\n4. **Social connection**: Designing for human relationships rather than replacement\n5. **Meaningful work**: Creating employment that provides purpose and dignity\n\n## OECD Framework Alignment\n\n- **Dimension**: People and Planet Context\n- **Principle Number**: P1 (part 3 of 3)\n- **Actor Responsibility**: All AI actors throughout lifecycle\n\n## Regulatory Context\n\nWell-being considerations inform:\n- EU AI Act prohibited practices (Article 5) addressing manipulation and exploitation\n- High-risk classifications for systems affecting health, safety and fundamental rights\n- Transparency obligations enabling informed decision-making\n- Human oversight requirements preserving agency\n\n## Measurement Approaches\n\nWell-being impacts can be assessed through:\n- Subjective well-being surveys and self-reporting\n- Objective health outcomes (physical and mental)\n- Social connection metrics and relationship quality\n- Work satisfaction and meaningful engagement indicators\n- OECD Better Life Index dimensions\n\n## Potential Risks to Well-Being\n\n- **Manipulation**: Exploiting psychological vulnerabilities\n- **Addiction**: Designing for excessive engagement\n- **Social isolation**: Replacing human interaction\n- **Deskilling**: Reducing human capabilities through over-reliance\n- **Stress and anxiety**: Information overload and constant monitoring\n- **Loss of agency**: Automated decision-making reducing self-determination\n\n## 2024 Revision Updates\n\nThe 2024 OECD revision strengthened well-being by:\n- Explicitly addressing mental health alongside physical health\n- Emphasising meaningful work beyond employment statistics\n- Connecting to social connection and community flourishing\n- Integrating with sustainability and inclusion concerns\n\n## Design Principles for Well-Being\n\n1. **Human augmentation**: Enhancing rather than replacing capabilities\n2. **Respectful defaults**: Protecting attention and cognitive resources\n3. **Transparent operation**: Building trust through understandable systems\n4. **Reversible decisions**: Preserving human control and correction\n5. **Social consideration**: Accounting for community and relational impacts\n\n## Related Standards\n\n- IEEE 7010-2020 - Recommended Practice for Assessing the Impact of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems on Human Well-Being\n- ISO/IEC TR 24030:2021 - Artificial intelligence (AI) — Use cases\n- WHO guidance on ethics and governance of AI for health\n\n## See Also\n\n- Human-Centred Values (AI-0159)\n- Fairness (OECD) (AI-0160)\n- Social Impact (AI-0170)\n- Accountability (AI-0165)\n\n---\n\n*Part of AI Grounded Ontology - OECD AI Principles Framework*\n*Aligned with OECD AI Principles 2024 and WHO health frameworks*\n\t- maturity:: draft\n\t- owl:class:: mv:WellBeing\n\t- owl:physicality:: ConceptualEntity\n\t- owl:role:: Concept\n\t- is-subclass-of:: [[Metaverse]]\n\t- belongsToDomain:: [[MetaverseDomain]]",
