Distinguished from augmented reality by genuine environmental understanding and physics-aware rendering, MR creates convincing composite experiences where digital content behaves according to real-world spatial and optical principles. Current implementations leverage advanced sensor fusion, low-latency processing, and sophisticated computer vision to anchor virtual objects reliably within physical space, supporting applications from industrial maintenance to collaborative design—though achieving universal photorealism and eliminating perceptible latency remain active research challenges.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The original definition was technically sound but lacked historical grounding and current implementation context. This revision anchors the concept within established academic frameworks whilst acknowledging practical limitations that distinguish aspirational capabilities from deployed reality. UK context remains limited in published literature; North England examples are speculative pending formal case study documentation.\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-11\n- **Review Status**: Comprehensive editorial review\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
