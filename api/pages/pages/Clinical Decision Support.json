CDS systems integrate patient data, medical knowledge bases, clinical guidelines, and evidence-based protocols to assist in diagnosis, treatment selection, medication management, and care coordination whilst maintaining clinician autonomy and clinical judgement.\n\t- #### Relationships\n\t  id:: clinical-decision-support-relationships\n\t  collapsed:: true\n\t\t- is-subclass-of:: [[MedicalAI]]\n\n## Clinical Decision Support\n\nClinical Decision Support refers to clinical decision support (cds) refers to ai systems that provide healthcare professionals with patient-specific assessments, recommendations, and information to support clinical decision-making at the point of care. cds systems integrate patient data, medical knowledge bases, clinical guidelines, and evidence-based protocols to assist in diagnosis, treatment selection, medication management, and care coordination whilst maintaining clinician autonomy and clinical judgement.\n\n- CDS adoption is widespread in healthcare systems globally, with significant penetration in hospital and outpatient settings to improve medication safety, diagnostic accuracy, and care coordination.\n  - Notable platforms include integrated EHR-based CDS modules, standalone AI-powered decision aids, and patient-facing tools supporting shared decision-making.\n  - In the UK, the National Health Service (NHS) increasingly incorporates CDS within digital transformation initiatives, emphasising interoperability (e.g., FHIR standards) and clinician usability.\n  - In North England, innovation hubs in Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield are advancing CDS research and deployment, often in collaboration with academic institutions and NHS trusts.\n- Technical capabilities have expanded to include predictive analytics, natural language processing, and personalised risk stratification, although challenges remain regarding alert fatigue, integration complexity, and clinician trust.\n- Standards and frameworks guiding CDS development and evaluation include ISO/IEEE 11073, HL7 FHIR Clinical Decision Support Implementation Guide, and NHS Digital’s clinical safety standards.\n\n## Technical Details\n\n- **Id**: clinical-decision-support-ontology\n- **Collapsed**: true\n- **Source Domain**: ai\n- **Status**: draft\n- **Public Access**: true\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic sources:\n  - Sutton RT, Pincock D, Baumgart DC, et al.
