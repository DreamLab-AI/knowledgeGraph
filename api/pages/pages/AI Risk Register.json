risk register is a structured repository that systematically documents, tracks, and manages identified risks associated with ai systems throughout their lifecycle, recording risk descriptions, severity assessments, likelihood evaluations, assigned ownership, mitigation strategies, and current status to support risk governance and decision-making. this register captures diverse risk categories including technical risks (model performance failures, robustness issues, adversarial vulnerabilities), ethical risks (fairness violations, discrimination, bias amplification), legal and compliance risks (regulatory violations, liability exposure, contractual breaches), operational risks (system availability, integration failures, resource constraints), security and privacy risks (data breaches, privacy violations, adversarial attacks), reputational risks (public backlash, stakeholder concerns, brand damage), and societal risks (unintended consequences, systemic impacts, dual-use concerns). each risk entry typically documents risk identifier and title, detailed description of the risk scenario, affected systems and stakeholders, likelihood rating (rare, unlikely, possible, likely, almost certain), consequence or severity rating (insignificant, minor, moderate, major, catastrophic), overall risk level (likelihood × consequence), assigned risk owner responsible for mitigation, current mitigation measures and controls, residual risk after mitigation, risk status (open, in-progress, mitigated, accepted), review dates and audit trail. the register supports risk governance by enabling risk-based decision-making, prioritization of mitigation efforts, compliance demonstration, trend analysis, and continuous monitoring. implementation aligns with enterprise risk management frameworks (iso 31000), ai-specific risk standards (iso/iec 23894:2023 ai risk management), and regulatory requirements including eu ai act article 9 risk management systems and financial services operational risk frameworks.\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n\t- Leading organisations across sectors—including finance, healthcare, and public services—now routinely maintain AI risk registers as part of their compliance and governance infrastructure\n\t- Platforms such as LayerX Security, Superblocks, and TrustCloud offer specialised tools for building and maintaining AI risk registers, often with integrations for model monitoring and audit trails\n- Notable organisations and platforms\n\t- UK-based firms like BenevolentAI (London) and Faculty (Cambridge) have published case studies on their use of AI risk registers for model governance\n\t- In North England, organisations such as the Greater Manchester Combined Authority and Leeds City Council have piloted AI risk registers for public sector AI deployments, focusing on transparency and accountability\n- Technical capabilities and limitations\n\t- Modern AI risk registers support granular tracking of risks by category (e.g., bias, security, regulatory), system, and data sensitivity\n\t- Limitations include the challenge of quantifying intangible risks (e.g., reputational damage) and the need for ongoing human oversight to ensure accuracy and relevance\n- Standards and frameworks\n\t- The NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) and ISO/IEC 42001 provide structured approaches to AI risk management, with the AI RMF Generative AI Profile (NIST-AI-600-1) offering specific guidance for generative AI systems\n\t- The EU AI Act has influenced UK regulatory expectations, particularly for high-risk AI systems\n\n## Technical Details\n\n- **Id**: 0394-ai-risk-register-about\n- **Collapsed**: true\n- **Domain Prefix**: AI\n- **Sequence Number**: 0394\n- **Filename History**:
