(1982) on Byzantine fault tolerance and the CAP theorem (Brewer, 2000)\n\t- Contemporary research focuses on the blockchain trilemma (decentralization, scalability, security) and the socio-technical implications of distributed systems\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n\t- Decentralized systems are widely adopted in finance, supply chain, and digital identity, with growing interest in public sector and civic applications\n\t- Notable platforms include Ethereum, Solana, and emerging Layer 1 blockchains with advanced consensus mechanisms\n\t- UK and North England examples where relevant\n\t\t- Manchester hosts several blockchain startups and research groups, including the Manchester Blockchain Society and collaborations with the University of Manchester\n\t\t- Leeds is home to the Leeds Blockchain Lab, which explores decentralised solutions for local government and public services\n\t\t- Newcastle and Sheffield have active fintech communities, with projects focusing on decentralised energy trading and digital identity\n\n- Technical capabilities and limitations\n\t- Decentralized networks offer enhanced security, transparency, and resilience against single points of failure\n\t- Limitations include scalability challenges, energy consumption (for proof-of-work systems), and regulatory uncertainty\n\t- Advances in consensus algorithms (e.g., proof-of-stake, sharding) are addressing some of these issues\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n\t- Industry standards such as the Blockchain Trilemma and the Decentralization Matrix (Latham & Watkins, 2023) provide frameworks for evaluating and comparing decentralised systems\n\t- Open-source protocols and collaborative development are key to the ongoing evolution of decentralised technologies\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers and sources\n\t- Nakamoto, S.
