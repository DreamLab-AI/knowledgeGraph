So rq here it is:\n\t\t- Team\n\t\t- Michael: Vircadia (clients: Deutsche Telekom, University\n\t\t  Academy 92) and Player Two (Gen 1 Closed Alpha #1, Gen 2 10k+\n\t\t  users). Has USA and TT access.\n\t\t- Soul: Quant @ HSBC. German, Brazilian, and Russian access.\n\t\t  Biotech background.\n\t\t- Ken: Designs and develops custom SOTA batteries and weapons\n\t\t  R&D. Based in Thailand with Thai and UK access.\n\t\t- Biscuits: PhD @ University of Salford. CTO and specialist at\n\t\t  UK firms on XR and blockchain. Has UK access.\n\t\t- Setup\n\t\t- Workshop: Compound in Thailand (Ken's) or rented space in\n\t\t  Taiwan. Use 3D printers for production and prototyping.\n\t\t- Marketing: Aim to be the Raspberry Pi of humanoid\n\t\t  waifurobotics and replace StabilityAI with a stable open-source\n\t\t  model funding and development business model (Apache 2.0 / MIT).\n\t\t- Tokenomics\n\t\t- Initial sale: US$50k for a Player Two wAIfu bot preorder (25%\n\t\t  burned, 75% for extra capital).\n\t\t- Staked tokens count towards ED3N Network voting.\n\t\t\t- Early: Open-source everything, members vote on next items to\n\t\t\t  build and release, and can vote to issue new tokens for\n\t\t\t  treasury.\n\t\t\t- Later: Tokens burned for discounted compute on in-house\n\t\t\t  clusters or sold to other robot owners for training on their\n\t\t\t  clusters (\"mining\").\n\t\t\t- ED3N (Network) Solution\n\t\t- Problems: Regulation targeting compute, centralized compute in\n\t\t  datacenters, unreliable decentralized compute.\n\t\t- Solution: Known compute and validated software stack in each\n\t\t  Player Two's wAIfu (Robot), improving with each generation.\n\t\t- wAIfu's can accept $ED3N tokens to perform edge compute for\n\t\t  other devices globally, supporting a distributed network.\n\t\t- Notes\n\t\t- Sell US$10-20m tokens on Solana, need KYC inroads (investors\n\t\t  can handshake to vendors or we use public platform).\n\t\t- Incorporate non-US entity if needed (ideally DAO, secondarily\n\t\t  Middle East or Asia) to save on cost and legal.\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
