The W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model defines how credentials are issued by trusted authorities, stored by holders in digital wallets, and presented to verifiers who can cryptographically confirm their authenticity without contacting the issuer. This enables a wide range of trust-based interactions in digital ecosystems while giving users control over their credential data.\n\t- ### Key Characteristics\n\t  id:: verifiable-credential-characteristics\n\t\t- **Cryptographically Secure**: Credentials include digital signatures that prove authenticity and prevent tampering\n\t\t- **Privacy-Preserving**: Holders control when and with whom they share credentials\n\t\t- **Selective Disclosure**: Users can reveal only specific attributes from credentials, not entire documents\n\t\t- **Machine-Verifiable**: Automated systems can verify credentials without human intervention\n\t\t- **Portable**: Credentials can be stored in any compliant wallet and presented across platforms\n\t\t- **Tamper-Evident**: Any modification to credential data invalidates the cryptographic proof\n\t\t- **Revocable**: Issuers can revoke credentials, with verifiers able to check revocation status\n\t\t- **Interoperable**: Standard data model enables cross-platform and cross-jurisdiction recognition\n\t\t- **Extensible**: Credential schemas can represent any type of claim or attestation\n\t- ### Technical Components\n\t  id:: verifiable-credential-components\n\t\t- [[Claim]] - Statements made by issuer about the credential subject (name, age, qualification, etc.)\n\t\t- [[Credential Metadata]] - Information about the credential itself (issuer, issuance date, expiration, type)\n\t\t- [[Cryptographic Proof]] - Digital signature or zero-knowledge proof demonstrating credential authenticity\n\t\t- [[Issuer Signature]] - Digital signature from the credential issuer's private key\n\t\t- [[Credential Schema]] - Defines structure and data types for credential claims\n\t\t- [[Credential Status]] - Mechanism for checking if credential has been revoked or suspended\n\t\t- [[Verifiable Presentation]] - Data derived from credentials that holders present to verifiers\n\t\t- [[Proof Format]] - Specific cryptographic method used (JSON Web Signature, Linked Data Proofs, etc.)\n\t\t- [[Holder Binding]] - Cryptographic link between credential and its legitimate holder\n\t- ### Functional Capabilities\n\t  id:: verifiable-credential-capabilities\n\t\t- **Credential Issuance**: Trusted entities issue cryptographically signed credentials to subjects\n\t\t- **Credential Storage**: Holders securely store credentials in digital wallets with encryption\n\t\t- **Credential Presentation**: Holders create verifiable presentations containing selected credential data\n\t\t- **Credential Verification**: Verifiers cryptographically check credential authenticity and validity\n\t\t- **Selective Disclosure**: Reveal only required attributes while keeping other claims private\n\t\t- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Prove credential attributes without revealing actual values (e.g., prove age >18 without revealing birthdate)\n\t\t- **Credential Composition**: Combine claims from multiple credentials into single presentation\n\t\t- **Revocation Checking**: Verify credentials haven't been revoked by issuers\n\t\t- **Holder Authentication**: Prove possession of credential through cryptographic challenge-response\n\t\t- **Multi-Signature Support**: Credentials can have multiple issuer signatures for co-signed attestations\n\t- ### Use Cases\n\t  id:: verifiable-credential-use-cases\n\t\t- **Educational Credentials**: Universities issue verifiable diplomas and transcripts that students control and share with employers\n\t\t- **Professional Licenses**: Government agencies issue professional licenses (medical, legal, etc.) as VCs\n\t\t- **Employment Verification**: Companies issue employment credentials for background checks and visa applications\n\t\t- **Age Verification**: Prove age requirements for age-restricted content without revealing exact age or identity\n\t\t- **Health Passes**: Vaccination certificates, test results, and health status credentials\n\t\t- **Financial KYC**: Reusable identity verification credentials accepted across financial institutions\n\t\t- **Access Credentials**: Digital keys and access permissions for physical and virtual spaces\n\t\t- **Supply Chain Certifications**: Product authenticity, origin, and compliance certifications\n\t\t- **Membership Credentials**: Gym memberships, loyalty programs, professional associations\n\t\t- **Metaverse Achievements**: Gaming achievements, virtual property ownership, and digital asset proofs\n\t\t- **Voting Credentials**: Voter registration and eligibility credentials for digital democracy\n\t- ### Standards & References\n\t  id:: verifiable-credential-standards\n\t\t- [[W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model]] -

The foundational concept builds on cryptographic proofs, digital signatures, and data integrity mechanisms to ensure authenticity, integrity, and privacy.\n  - The academic foundations lie in cryptography, distributed identity management, and trust frameworks, with extensive research into privacy-preserving selective disclosure and interoperable data models.\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- The W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model 2.0 became a formal W3C Recommendation in May 2025, refining terminology, enhancing privacy features, and improving extensibility and alignment with modern cryptographic standards such as JOSE/COSE and Data Integrity proofs.\n  - This update facilitates easier prototyping of new credential types and better privacy controls, allowing users to disclose only necessary claims.\n- Industry adoption spans sectors including health, finance, travel, education, and government identity management.\n  - Leading platforms implement VCs for digital wallets, enabling holders to store and selectively share credentials.\n- Technical capabilities include:\n  - Support for multiple cryptographic encodings (JSON-LD, JWT, SD-JWT).\n  - Privacy-preserving selective disclosure.\n  - Interoperability across systems and borders.\n- Limitations remain in widespread adoption due to legacy systems, varying regulatory environments, and user experience challenges.\n- Standards and frameworks:\n  - The VC 2.0 specification is part of a family of interoperable W3C Recommendations.\n  - Integration with Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) frameworks and eIDAS compliance in Europe is ongoing.\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers and sources:\n  -
