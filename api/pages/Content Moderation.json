NetChoice, LLC*) shapes interpretation[5]\n  - EU governance: Digital Services Act mandates transparency, due process, and user appeal mechanisms\n  - Emerging international standards emphasise procedural fairness, appeals processes, and algorithmic accountability\n  - Trust & Safety Professional Association (TSPA) provides industry guidance and professional development\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic and professional sources\n  - Trust & Safety Professional Association (2024). \"What Is Content Moderation?\" *TSPA Curriculum: TS Fundamentals*. Available at: tspa.org/curriculum/ts-fundamentals/content-moderation-and-operations/what-is-content-moderation/\n    - Establishes definitional consensus; emphasises safety, expression, and business rationale\n  \n  - Lo, J.

The definition has been refined to reflect 2025 understanding of moderation as multi-dimensional rather than purely removal-focused.\n\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-11\n- **Review Status**: Comprehensive editorial review\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
