The \"State of AI Report 2024\" added a new section on safety to address the catastrophic risks that these systems could pose. There are also documented instances of AI systems circumventing shutdown commands in testing environments, raising questions about their growing autonomy.\n\n\t- ## The Need for Modular Open-Source Solutions:\n\t\t- A topologically flat, inclusive, permissionless, federated, and [[Open Source]] Metaverse is essential to address these challenges. Open-source AI tooling and large language models can improve creativity, safeguarding, and governance, while breaking down language and accessibility barriers. Secure, trusted, and task-appropriate solutions can promote collaboration and innovation.\n\n\t- ### Trust, Accessibility, and Governance:\n\t\t- To create a successful open-source Metaverse, it is crucial to address trust, accessibility, and governance challenges. By integrating decentralized and secure technologies such as blockchain and distributed ledger systems, a more transparent and trustworthy infrastructure can be established. Blockchain technology is being leveraged to enhance trust by providing an immutable and transparent ledger for transactions and interactions. Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are another important innovation, providing users with a secure digital identity that they can use across different virtual environments. One promising approach to governance is the use of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), which provide a model for automated governance that is based on code rather than a traditional hierarchical structure.\n\n\t\t- ## Wallets, seeds, keys and BIP39\n\t - In all the cryptographic systems described in this book everything isderived from a private key. This is an enormous number, and the input tothe trapdoor function described earlier. As usual, it’s beyond the scopeof this book to ‘rehash’ the detail. Prof Bill Buchanan OBE has a [greatpost](https://medium.com/asecuritysite-when-bob-met-alice/can-i-derive-the-private-key-from-the-public-key-ba3609256ec)on the basic version of this process.\n\t - In modern wallets, private keys (and so too their public keys), andaddresses, are generated hierarchically. This is all part of[BIP-0032](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki).It starts with a single [monstrouslylarge](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=2%5E512) number of up to 512bits. From this are crafted Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets,which use ‘derivation paths’ to make a tree of public/private key pairs,all seeded from this first number. This means that knowing the initialnumber, and the derivation path applied to it (just another number),wallets can search down the tree of derivations and find all thepossible addresses. In this way a whole group of active addressesbelonging to an entity can be held conveniently in one huge number (aconcatenation of the input and path). This is the seed. Seeds are evenmore conveniently abstracted into a mnemonic called a seed phrase.Anyone interacting with these systems will see a 12 word (128 bits ofentropy which is considered to be[‘enough’](https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1433375602808066049)) or24 word (256 bit) seed phrase. That phrase accesses the whole of theassets stored by that entity in the blockchain under it. A master key.These seeds can be [generated byhand](https://vault12.com/securemycrypto/cryptocurrency-security-how-to/dice-crypto-recovery-seed/)with dice, remember it’s just a huge number and the onward cryptographyat play here.\n\t - An address in Bitcoin is derived from the public/private key pair. Againthis is a one way hash function. The public/private keys can’t be foundfrom the address. Addresses are really only a thing in wallets. Theycontain the element necessary to interact with the UTXOs. Many UTXOs canreside under an address, in that they just share the same keys. Walletsand nodes can monitor the blockchain to see transactions that ‘belong’to addresses owned by the wallet, then they can perform unlocking ofthose funds to move them, through operations on the UTXOs via keys.\n\n\t\t- ### Mitigating Risks and Fostering a Balanced Ecosystem\n\t\t\t- To address these concerns and foster a more balanced and inclusive AI ecosystem, several recommendations warrant consideration:\n\t\t\t\t- **Enhancing Clarity and Specificity:** Refining the definition of \"frontier models\" with clear and objective criteria would reduce ambiguity and prevent unintended overreach. This could involve establishing specific benchmarks for capabilities of concern rather than relying solely on computational thresholds.\n\t\t\t\t- **Supporting Startups and New Entrants:** Implementing tiered compliance requirements based on the scale and potential risks associated with different models would alleviate the burden on startups and foster a more equitable regulatory environment. Additionally, providing resources and support mechanisms for startups, such as funding initiatives and technical assistance programmes, would further level the playing field.\n\t\t\t\t- **Ensuring Regulatory Independence:** Exploring alternative funding mechanisms for the Frontier Model Division, such as direct appropriations or public-private partnerships with diverse stakeholders, would reduce the risk of regulatory capture and ensure its impartiality.\n\t\t\t\t- **Promoting Open-Source Collaboration:** Actively supporting and incentivizing open-source AI development through funding initiatives, research collaborations, and knowledge-sharing platforms would counteract any potential chilling effects of the bill and foster a more collaborative and inclusive AI ecosystem.\n\n\t- ## End to end private messages\n\t\t- The current state of direct messages (DMs) on Nostr presents significant privacy concerns. Messages are encrypted using a single public key, exposing metadata and leaving past conversations vulnerable if a private key gets compromised.\n\t\t- To address these issues, a new [DM specification](https://github.com/nostrworld/nostriga/issues/10) (nip104) proposes a double ratchet encryption scheme with ephemeral keys. This approach aims to provide:\n\t\t\t- **Metadata privacy:** Hiding information about who is communicating with whom and how often.\n\t\t\t- **Forward secrecy:** Protecting past messages even if a current private key is compromised.\n\t\t\t- **Post-compromise secrecy:** Ensuring future messages remain secure even if a past private key is compromised.\n\t\t- The new DM spec utilises two key features of Nostr to achieve its privacy goals:\n\t\t\t- **Abundant key space:** Nostr offers an almost infinite number of public-private key pairs, allowing for the generation and disposal of keys without exhaustion.\n\t\t\t- **Decentralized identity:** Nostr's inherent identity system eliminates the need for a central server to verify user identities, a requirement in traditional end-to-end encrypted messaging protocols like Signal.\n\n\t- #### Trust, Accessibility, and Governance\n\t\t- To create a successful open-source Metaverse, it is crucial to address\n\t\t  trust, accessibility, and governance challenges. By integrating\n\t\t  decentralized and secure technologies such as blockchain and distributed\n\t\t  ledger systems, a more transparent and trustworthy infrastructure can be\n\t\t  established.\n\n\t\t- ### The Final Test and Order of AI Risks\n\t - **Hypothetical Scenarios:** Details a hypothetical scenario set in 2045, where a city home to AI trillionaires tests a superintelligent model, emphasizing the importance of addressing AI risks in stages.\n\t - **Order of Risks:** Discusses the importance of considering the order of AI risks, noting that intermediate stages of AI development may indirectly affect the very institutions needed to address existential risks from superintelligence.\n\n\t\t\t\t- ### Deloitte survey of 2,800 director to C-suite executives\n\t\t\t\t\t- Only 1 in 5 believed their organization was highly or very highly prepared to address AI skills needs\n\t\t\t\t\t- Only 47% said they are sufficiently educating employees about AI\n\npublic:: true\n\n- #Public page automatically published\n- Parallels and Common Points:\n\t- You both see potential in decentralized technologies, realigned economic incentives, and new forms of networked collaboration and governance to address major societal challenges.\n\t- There is a shared interest in the disruptive potential from the confluence of economic paradigm shifts and emerging technologies like AI, blockchain, virtual/augmented reality.\n\t- You both highlight the importance of open source software and decentralized systems in empowering users and diversifying governance models.\n\t- The transformative potential of Bitcoin and its surrounding ecosystem is a common thread, with recognition of its ability to enable permissionless, borderless value transfer.\n\t- You both advocate for technology having a role in promoting equality and equity of access globally, especially for emerging markets.\n\t- The writings share an optimistic, future-oriented outlook on the potential of thoughtfully deployed technology to solve complex problems.\n- [Tim Reutemann – Medium](https://tim-reutemann.medium.com/)\n\t- In summary, Reutemann envisions a future shaped by decentralized technologies, realigned economic incentives, and new forms of networked collaboration and governance. While ambitious, he sees potential for these ideas to help address major societal challenges around climate change, inequality, and the impacts of automation. The vision combines cypherpunk values of individual empowerment with a belief in the problem-solving potential of thoughtfully deployed AI and well-designed economic policies.\n\t- Liquid Democracy and Governance: Reutemann is a strong proponent of liquid democracy, a form of delegative democracy that allows voters to either vote directly on issues or delegate their votes to representatives. This enables a more fluid and responsive form of distributed governance compared to traditional representative democracy. His project \"Liquid Reign\" appears to be focused on implementing liquid democracy principles.\n\t- Anarchism and Decentralization: There are undertones of anarchist philosophy in Reutemann's writing, with an emphasis on decentralized systems and mistrust of centralized authorities. He envisions new models of organization and coordination enabled by technologies like blockchains.\n\t- Cypherpunk Ethos: In the cypherpunk tradition, Reutemann advocates for the use of cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies to empower individuals and limit the power of governments and corporations. This aligns with his interest in Bitcoin and other decentralized digital assets.\n\t- Potential of AI: While cautious about malicious applications like AI-powered propaganda, Reutemann sees promise in beneficial uses of AI to solve complex problems. He proposes using AI to combat misinformation and suggests AI will be key to tackling major challenges.\n\t- Universal Basic Income and Incentive Alignment: Reutemann views policies like universal basic income (UBI) and carbon taxes & dividends as stepping stones towards aligning economic incentives with social goods. UBI could provide a safety net and bargaining power for individuals in an increasingly automated economy.\n\t- Intersection of Economic and Technological Disruption: A common theme is the transformative, disruptive potential from the confluence of economic paradigm shifts and emerging technologies like AI, blockchain, virtual/augmented reality, and more. Reutemann anticipates this combination to upend legacy institutions and ideologies.\n- [Tim Reutemann | LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timschloendorn/)\n-\n\n\t- ### Safety and Control\n\t\t- A growing area of concern is the safety and control of highly capable future AI systems.

There are also documented instances of AI systems circumventing shutdown commands in testing environments, raising questions about their growing autonomy.\n\t\t- The main risk is actually the concentration of power in a few huge corporations.

However, it has limitations in terms of scalability and programmability. Layer 2 and Layer 3 solutions are being developed to address these limitations and unlock the full potential of the Bitcoin network.\n\n- ### Summary\n\t- With all this attention it seems timely to explore the potential ofrecent technologies, which can address collaborative mixed realityinteractions in itbusiness to business (B2B), itbusiness to customer(B2C), and the newer C2C (social commerce; itcreator to consumer,customer to customer, consumer to consumer [[jones2008trust]].\n\t-\n\t- This book seeks to overview and explain the available open sourcetechnologies. It supports an open source [githubrepository](https://github.com/flossverse/product) which enables SMEs toaccess these emergent platforms and ecosystems. It aims to build towarda minimum viable product for trust minimised transfer of value within asocial immersive space, but also across all internet connected devices.\n\t- Referencing is in two styles; academic works and books are numeric,while opinion pieces, gray statistics, and pertinent news articles arehyperlinked from the text. This hybrid style yields about twice thecitation density of a normal PhD thesis, which is a lot. For this reasonthe normal blue hyperlink colour was eschewed in favour of a moreaesthetic “gray”.\n\n- ### Addressing Hardware Limitations:\n  While Stable Diffusion requires a decent GPU for optimal performance, several solutions are emerging to address hardware limitations:\n  Cloud-based Solutions: Platforms like [RunDiffusion](https://app.rundiffusion.com/)\n- https://www.forbes.com/sites/iainmartin/2024/03/20/key-stable-diffusion-researchers-leave-stability-ai-as-company-flounders/\n  Stable diffusion is a company that specializes in developing advanced artificial intelligence models.

By using open-source AI tooling and large language models, it is possible to improve creativity, safeguarding, and governance, while breaking down language barriers and accessibility challenges. Implementing secure, trusted, and task-appropriate solutions can promote collaboration and innovation across various industries.\n\n- ## **Conclusion**\n  \n  AI is transforming the call center industry, and agentic systems are at the forefront of this transformation. By automating tasks, personalizing interactions, and providing valuable insights, agentic AI is enabling call centers to operate more efficiently and deliver better customer experiences. However, it is crucial to address the challenges and ethical considerations associated with these advanced AI systems to ensure their responsible and beneficial use. By leveraging the capabilities of AI and agentic systems, call centers can effectively address challenges such as agent burnout, high attrition rates, and the increasing demand for personalized customer service. As AI technology continues to evolve, we can expect even more innovative applications in the call center industry, leading to further improvements in customer service and operational efficiency. Businesses that embrace these advancements and proactively address the ethical considerations will be well-positioned to thrive in the evolving landscape of customer service.\n\n- #### BTCPayServer\n- BTCPayServer is one of the recipients of a Spiral grant.
