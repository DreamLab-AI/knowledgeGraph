Edge security differs from cloud security by prioritizing offline operation, physical accessibility threats, and extreme resource scarcity. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) like ARM TrustZone isolate sensitive AI operations in hardware-protected secure enclaves, preventing unauthorized model inspection or parameter access even by device operating systems. Model encryption protects intellectual property; weights are decrypted only within TEEs during inference. Secure bootstrap chains verify device firmware integrity before executing AI models, preventing compromised code from manipulating inference. Defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks include input validation, anomaly detection, and certified robustness techniques tolerating small input perturbations. Model extraction attacks steal intellectual property by querying inference endpoints; edge systems mitigate this through rate limiting, access control, and covert deployment of detection mechanisms. Data poisoning attacks corrupt local training in federated learning systems; Byzantine-robust aggregation protocols identify and exclude corrupted updates. Physical attacks target edge devices accessing unprotected memory; countermeasures include side-channel resistance, differential power analysis defenses, and information-flow isolation. Privacy preservation through differential privacy adds calibrated noise to gradients and outputs, providing formal privacy guarantees. Standards like NIST AI Risk Management Framework and ARM TrustZone documentation guide secure deployment. Edge security requires balancing protection strength against computational/energy overhead; resource-constrained devices cannot employ computationally expensive cryptographic primitives. Effective edge AI security integrates hardware-level protections (TEEs, secure boot), software hardening (model encryption, access control), and algorithmic defenses (certified robustness) forming defense-in-depth architectures.\n    - maturity:: mature\n    - source:: \n    - authority-score:: 0.95\n\n  - **Semantic Classification**\n    - owl:class:: aigo:EdgeAISecurity\n    - owl:physicality:: VirtualEntity\n    - owl:role:: Process\n    - owl:inferred-class:: aigo:VirtualProcess\n    - belongsToDomain:: [[AIEthicsDomain]]\n    - implementedInLayer:: [[ConceptualLayer]]\n\n  - #### Relationships\n    id:: edge-ai-security-(ai-0445)-relationships\n\n  - #### OWL Axioms\n    id:: edge-ai-security-(ai-0445)-owl-axioms\n    collapsed:: true\n    - ```clojure\n      (Declaration (Class :EdgeAISecurity))\n(AnnotationAssertion rdfs:label :EdgeAISecurity \"Edge AI Security\"@en)\n(SubClassOf :EdgeAISecurity :AIGovernancePrinciple)\n\n;; Security Threats\n(SubClassOf :EdgeAISecurity\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :mitigates :AdversarialAttack))\n(SubClassOf :EdgeAISecurity\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :mitigates :ModelExtractionAttack))\n(SubClassOf :EdgeAISecurity\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :mitigates :DataPoisoning))\n\n;; Protection Mechanisms\n(SubClassOf :EdgeAISecurity\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :implements :TrustedExecutionEnvironment))\n(SubClassOf :EdgeAISecurity\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :implements :ModelEncryption))\n(SubClassOf :EdgeAISecurity\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :implements :SecureBootstrap))\n\n;; Standards Reference\n(AnnotationAssertion rdfs:seeAlso :EdgeAISecurity\n  \"ARM TrustZone for Cortex-M\")\n(AnnotationAssertion rdfs:seeAlso :EdgeAISecurity\n  \"NIST AI Risk Management Framework\")\n      ```\n\n- ## About Edge AI Security (AI-0445)\n  id:: edge-ai-security-(ai-0445)-about\n\n  - \n  -\n  \n\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
