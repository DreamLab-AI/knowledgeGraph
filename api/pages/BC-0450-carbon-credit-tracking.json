The voluntary carbon market reached $2 billion in trading volume in 2023, with projections suggesting growth to $50-100 billion by 2030 as corporations accelerate net-zero commitments and climate regulations tighten globally. However, carbon markets suffer from fundamental challenges including double-counting of emissions reductions, opaque pricing, fraudulent credits from non-existent or non-additional projects, and complex verification processes that create delays and costs averaging $50,000-200,000 per project registration. When a company purchases carbon offsets to neutralise its emissions, current registry systems make it difficult to verify that those credits represent genuine, permanent carbon reductions and haven't been sold to multiple buyers or claimed towards different targets. The 2023 investigation by The Guardian revealing widespread fraud in rainforest carbon credits highlighted the credibility crisis undermining market confidence and climate action effectiveness. Blockchain technology addresses these systemic issues by creating immutable records of credit issuance, ownership, and retirement that prevent double-counting, whilst smart contracts automate verification processes and enable fractionalisation that expands market access. Tokenised carbon credits recorded on distributed ledgers provide transparent pricing, instant settlement, and programmatic integration with corporate carbon accounting systems. Platforms including Toucan Protocol, KlimaDAO, Flowcarbon, and Xpansiv have deployed blockchain carbon credit registries that have tokenised over 30 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, whilst major carbon registries including Verra and Gold Standard are piloting blockchain integration to enhance their existing certification infrastructure. The technology proves particularly valuable for implementing Paris Agreement Article 6 mechanisms that require robust tracking to prevent double-claiming of emissions reductions across multiple national jurisdictions.\n\n\t- ### Industry Challenge\n\t\t- Carbon markets face a fundamental transparency problem that undermines their core purpose of efficiently reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Current carbon credit registries operate as centralised databases with limited interoperability, creating information silos that prevent comprehensive tracking when credits move between jurisdictions, change ownership multiple times, or undergo retirement. This fragmentation enables double-counting where the same emission reduction is claimed by multiple parties, effectively negating the environmental benefit. The Ecosystem Marketplace estimates that 10-20% of carbon credits in voluntary markets may involve some form of double-counting or fraudulent claims.\n\t\t- Additionality verification, the requirement that carbon credits represent emission reductions beyond business-as-usual scenarios, remains contentious and subjective. Many renewable energy projects that would have proceeded regardless of carbon finance are nevertheless issued credits, creating inflated supply that depresses prices and reduces incentives for genuine additional projects. The complex, manual verification processes required to establish additionality create barriers for smaller projects and developing country initiatives that lack resources for extensive documentation and third-party auditing.\n\t\t- Pricing opacity and market fragmentation prevent efficient capital allocation towards highest-impact climate solutions. Carbon credit prices vary from under $1 to over $100 per tonne depending on project type, vintage, co-benefits, and buyer preferences, but standardised pricing data is limited. This opacity disadvantages project developers who cannot accurately predict revenues, whilst buyers struggle to assess fair value and compare offerings across different registries and methodologies.\n\t\t- Permanence risk threatens the integrity of nature-based carbon credits. Forests sequestering carbon may burn in wildfires, agricultural soil carbon may be released through changed land management, and carbon capture projects may fail technically. Current registry systems lack dynamic monitoring to detect and address permanence failures, creating unreversed credits that overstate climate impact. The 2021 California wildfires released emissions from forest offset projects that had generated credits already sold and used for compliance, highlighting the permanence monitoring gap.\n\t\t- Corporate net-zero commitments are driving explosive demand growth, with over 5,000 companies pledging net-zero targets. However, the quality variation in carbon credits creates reputational risks for companies whose offset portfolios include questionable credits. The lack of standardised quality metrics and transparent methodologies makes it difficult for buyers to distinguish high-integrity credits from greenwashing enablers, creating market inefficiency and slowing corporate climate action.\n\n\t- ### Technical Architecture\n\t\t- Blockchain carbon credit systems digitise credits as tokens on distributed ledgers, creating programmable assets with embedded metadata about project type, vintage, verification standard, co-benefits, and geographic location. Each credit token represents one tonne of CO2 equivalent emission reduction or removal, with smart contracts enforcing one-time use through permanent retirement mechanisms that prevent double-counting. The tokenisation architecture typically uses [[ERC-20]] or [[ERC-721]] standards on [[Ethereum]], [[Polygon]], or [[Celo]] networks, balancing transparency benefits of public blockchains with transaction cost considerations.\n\t\t- Registry integration connects blockchain platforms with established carbon standards including [[Verra VCS]], [[Gold Standard]], [[Climate Action Reserve]], and [[American Carbon Registry]]. Credits verified under these standards are bridged onto blockchain through oracles and custodian mechanisms that verify credit authenticity before minting tokens. This integration maintains the integrity of existing verification infrastructure whilst adding blockchain transparency and programmability. Some platforms retire credits in traditional registries upon tokenisation to prevent the credits from existing in both systems simultaneously, whilst others maintain synchronisation between on-chain tokens and registry records.\n\t\t- Smart contracts automate carbon credit lifecycle management including issuance based on verified monitoring reports, transfer of ownership, fractionalisation enabling small-scale purchases, and permanent retirement that burns tokens to prevent reuse. Advanced contracts implement temporal restrictions ensuring credits are used within specified timeframes, geographic matching requiring buyers to use credits from specific regions, and co-benefit verification ensuring credits deliver social and ecological benefits beyond carbon reduction.\n\t\t- Monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) integration represents a critical architecture component. IoT sensors measuring forest biomass, soil carbon content, or renewable energy generation feed data to blockchain systems via oracles, enabling near real-time verification rather than annual audits. Satellite imagery analysis, machine learning algorithms detecting deforestation, and remote sensing technologies provide independent verification of project performance. This automated MRV can reduce verification costs by 60-80% whilst improving accuracy and enabling dynamic credit adjustments when project performance changes.\n\t\t- Integration with corporate carbon accounting systems enables programmatic retirement of credits to match emissions inventories. APIs connect blockchain carbon registries with enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, sustainability reporting platforms, and carbon management software. Smart contracts can automatically purchase and retire credits based on measured emissions, implementing carbon neutrality programmes without manual intervention. This integration supports emerging voluntary carbon markets where emissions and offsets are tracked in real-time rather than annual reconciliation cycles.\n\n\t- ### Real-World Implementations\n\t\t- **Toucan Protocol**: Launched in 2021, Toucan Protocol created infrastructure for bridging carbon credits from traditional registries onto blockchain, primarily using Polygon for lower transaction costs compared to Ethereum mainnet. The platform has tokenised over 25 million tonnes of CO2 credits from Verra registry, creating liquid carbon tokens tradeable on decentralised exchanges. Toucan's Base Carbon Tonne (BCT) token represents a basket of diverse carbon credits meeting minimum quality standards, enabling price discovery and market liquidity. The protocol includes retirement infrastructure where buyers burn tokens to claim environmental benefit, with immutable records proving retirement that can be independently verified. Over 2,000 organisations and individuals have used Toucan to retire credits, with transparent on-chain records preventing double-counting. The platform's open-source architecture has been adopted by multiple climate projects building applications including carbon-backed stablecoins and automated corporate carbon neutrality systems.\n\t\t- **KlimaDAO**: This decentralised autonomous organisation launched in 2021 to accelerate carbon market growth through blockchain technology and mechanism design. KlimaDAO purchases and locks carbon credits tokenised through Toucan Protocol, backing its KLIMA token with carbon assets. The protocol has absorbed over 18 million tonnes of carbon credits from circulation, aiming to create price pressure that incentivises higher carbon prices and increased investment in carbon reduction projects. KlimaDAO introduced bonding mechanisms where users exchange carbon credits or stablecoins for discounted KLIMA tokens, with proceeds used to acquire more carbon credits. The treasury holds over $50 million in carbon assets, making it one of the largest carbon credit holders globally. Whilst the protocol faced criticism about price volatility and market impact, it demonstrated blockchain's potential to create new carbon market mechanisms beyond traditional buyer-seller models.\n\t\t- **Flowcarbon**: Founded in 2022 by WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann, Flowcarbon aims to tokenise large volumes of high-quality carbon credits for institutional buyers. The platform partnered with major carbon project developers including South Pole and 3Degrees to tokenise credits as Goddess Nature Token (GNT). Flowcarbon emphasises quality filtering, only tokenising credits from projects meeting stringent additionality and permanence criteria. The platform targets corporate buyers needing reliable offset portfolios for net-zero strategies, providing blockchain transparency whilst maintaining quality standards that address greenwashing concerns. Initial commitments from partners represent potential tokenisation of over 100 million tonnes of credits, though actual tokenisation has proceeded more slowly than initially projected due to market conditions and quality verification processes.\n\t\t- **Xpansiv CBL**: Xpansiv operates the Chicago-based spot exchange for environmental commodities including carbon credits, renewable energy certificates, and water rights. The platform integrated blockchain technology through its CBL (Carbon Based Ledgers) infrastructure, creating immutable records of environmental commodity ownership and retirement. CBL has facilitated trading of over 800 million environmental commodity units representing billions of dollars in transactions. The platform serves institutional buyers including utilities, corporations, and traders, providing regulated market infrastructure with blockchain transparency. Xpansiv's acquisition of major carbon registries positions it to integrate blockchain tracking across large portions of compliance and voluntary carbon markets.\n\t\t- **Verra Registry Blockchain Pilot**: Verra, the world's largest carbon credit registry managing over 1.7 billion issued credits, initiated blockchain pilot programmes to explore distributed ledger integration. The trials test blockchain solutions for credit tokenisation, fractionalisation, and retirement whilst maintaining Verra's existing verification standards. The pilots address concerns about blockchain energy consumption by using proof-of-stake networks and explore governance models that balance decentralisation benefits with regulatory compliance requirements. Successful integration could bring blockchain transparency to the largest portion of voluntary carbon markets, with Verra credits representing approximately 75% of voluntary market share.\n\t\t- **Singapore Climate Impact X (CIX)**: This carbon marketplace backed by DBS Bank, Singapore Exchange, Standard Chartered, and Temasek launched blockchain-based carbon credit trading infrastructure in 2021. CIX combines blockchain transparency with institutional-grade verification processes, targeting Southeast Asian project developers and corporate buyers. The platform has facilitated trading of over 1 million carbon credits with blockchain records ensuring retirement verification. CIX integrates satellite monitoring and AI-powered MRV technologies to enhance project verification whilst reducing costs, aiming to increase carbon market access for small-scale projects in developing countries.\n\n\t- ### Standards and Regulations\n\t\t- Carbon credit standards establish methodologies for quantifying emission reductions and verification requirements. [[Verra VCS]] (Verified Carbon Standard) dominates voluntary markets with over 1,800 registered projects across 80 countries. [[Gold Standard]] emphasises sustainable development co-benefits alongside carbon reduction, certifying projects that deliver social and economic benefits to local communities. [[Climate Action Reserve]] focuses on North American projects with particularly stringent protocols for forestry and methane capture. [[American Carbon Registry]] pioneered carbon crediting methodologies and maintains focus on innovation including blue carbon and soil carbon projects.\n\t\t- The [[Paris Agreement]] Article 6 establishes frameworks for international carbon market cooperation, requiring robust tracking to prevent double-counting when emission reductions contribute to multiple countries' Nationally Determined Contributions. Blockchain technology is being piloted for Article 6 implementation by several countries including Switzerland, Singapore, and Ghana. The corresponding adjustments required under Article 6 to ensure environmental integrity align well with blockchain's transparency and immutability characteristics.\n\t\t- Regulatory oversight of carbon markets varies significantly by jurisdiction. The European Union's Emissions Trading System (ETS), the world's largest compliance carbon market, maintains its own registry system but is exploring blockchain for enhanced monitoring. California's cap-and-trade programme includes rigorous offset protocols but hasn't yet integrated blockchain technology. Voluntary market regulation remains limited, creating space for blockchain platforms to establish de facto standards through market adoption.\n\t\t- Emerging regulations around corporate sustainability reporting including the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and SEC climate disclosure rules require verified carbon offset information. Blockchain carbon registries provide audit trails and immutable records that align with these reporting requirements, potentially reducing audit costs and improving disclosure accuracy.\n\t\t- Standardisation efforts including the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) Core Carbon Principles aim to establish quality benchmarks for carbon credits. Blockchain platforms implementing these standards through smart contract logic could automate quality verification and create transparent quality tiers that guide buyer decisions and combat greenwashing.\n\n\t- ### Business Impact and ROI\n\t\t- Blockchain carbon credit platforms reduce transaction costs substantially compared to traditional registries. Credit issuance costs decrease from $50,000-200,000 per project to potential levels of $10,000-30,000 through automated verification and streamlined processes. Transaction fees for credit transfers drop from $500-2,000 per transaction to under $50 on efficient blockchain networks, whilst settlement times decrease from days to minutes.\n\t\t- Market liquidity improvements benefit both project developers and buyers. Tokenised carbon credits trade on decentralised exchanges with transparent pricing and instant settlement, compared to opaque bilateral negotiations in traditional markets. This liquidity enables project developers to access working capital by selling forward credits based on projected performance, addressing the chronic underfunding of carbon projects in developing countries. Some developers report 30-50% faster access to carbon revenue through blockchain platforms compared to traditional registry processes.\n\t\t- Fractionalisation enables small-scale buyers including individuals and small businesses to participate in carbon markets previously accessible only to large corporations. Blockchain platforms allow purchase of fractions of credits, with some supporting transactions as small as 0.01 tonnes (approximately $0.50-2 at current prices). This expanded access has brought thousands of new buyers into voluntary carbon markets, growing demand and supporting higher carbon prices that benefit project developers.\n\t\t- Price discovery improvements from transparent blockchain markets help both buyers and sellers assess fair value. On-chain trading history provides publicly verifiable pricing data unavailable in traditional bilateral markets, reducing information asymmetries. Analysis of Toucan Protocol markets shows that tokenised credit prices converge toward equilibrium more efficiently than off-chain markets, with bid-ask spreads 40-60% narrower than traditional markets.\n\t\t- Corporate carbon neutrality programmes achieve cost savings and credibility improvements through blockchain integration. Automated retirement processes reduce administrative overhead by 60-80%, whilst immutable retirement records provide verifiable proof for sustainability reporting and marketing claims. Companies using blockchain carbon platforms report 30-50% reductions in greenwashing accusations compared to traditional offset programmes, protecting brand reputation and reducing legal risks.\n\t\t- Implementation costs vary based on integration complexity and transaction volumes. Blockchain platform fees typically range from 1-3% of credit value compared to 5-10% for traditional brokers and registries. For corporate buyers retiring over 10,000 tonnes annually, blockchain platforms can reduce total carbon market participation costs by £100,000-500,000 annually through lower fees and reduced administrative overhead.\n\n\t- ### Sustainability Benefits\n\t\t- Enhanced transparency from blockchain carbon tracking strengthens market integrity and climate impact. By preventing double-counting through immutable retirement records, blockchain platforms ensure that each tonne of emissions reduction is only claimed once, maintaining environmental integrity that underpins carbon market effectiveness. The elimination of double-counting fraud could prevent overstatement of global emission reductions by an estimated 10-20%, ensuring that carbon markets deliver genuine climate benefits.\n\t\t- Improved verification efficiency enables expansion of carbon markets to include smaller projects and developing country initiatives currently excluded due to high verification costs. Automated MRV using IoT sensors, satellite imagery, and blockchain recording reduces verification costs by 60-80%, making projects viable that would be uneconomical under traditional verification regimes. This expansion could bring an additional 50-100 million tonnes of carbon credits to market annually, representing £1-5 billion in climate finance flowing to underserved regions.\n\t\t- Dynamic permanence monitoring addresses one of carbon markets' most significant credibility challenges. Blockchain platforms integrated with satellite monitoring and AI detection systems can identify when forest carbon projects suffer fire damage or agricultural carbon storage is reversed. Smart contracts automatically adjust credit validity or trigger insurance mechanisms that replace compromised credits, maintaining environmental integrity across project lifetimes. This ongoing verification contrasts with traditional one-time certification followed by minimal monitoring.\n\t\t- Market efficiency improvements from transparent pricing, instant settlement, and reduced transaction costs channel more climate finance towards actual carbon reduction rather than intermediary fees. Traditional carbon markets often see 30-50% of credit value consumed by brokers, verifiers, and administrative processes. Blockchain platforms reducing intermediary costs to 5-10% could increase project developer revenues by 40-60%, improving project economics and enabling more marginal climate solutions to achieve viability.\n\t\t- Integration with corporate carbon accounting enables more ambitious net-zero strategies by reducing offset costs and increasing confidence in offset quality. Companies report that blockchain carbon platforms facilitate 20-40% increases in voluntary offset purchases due to improved trust and reduced acquisition complexity. This increased corporate demand supports higher carbon prices that incentivise additional emission reduction projects, creating a virtuous cycle of climate finance and action.\n\n\t- ### Technology Stack\n\t\t- **Blockchain Platforms**: [[Ethereum]] provides the most established infrastructure for carbon credit tokenisation, with extensive DeFi ecosystem integration enabling sophisticated carbon financial instruments. [[Polygon]] offers lower transaction costs whilst maintaining Ethereum compatibility, making it attractive for high-volume carbon credit trading. [[Celo]] provides mobile-first architecture and carbon-negative operations, aligning with climate-focused applications. [[Algorand]] offers high throughput and minimal energy consumption through pure proof-of-stake consensus.\n\t\t- **Token Standards**: [[ERC-20]] fungible tokens represent standardised carbon credits with identical characteristics, enabling liquidity through interchangeability. [[ERC-721]] non-fungible tokens represent unique credits with specific project attributes, vintage years, and co-benefits that command premium pricing. [[ERC-1155]] hybrid standards enable both fungible and non-fungible characteristics within single contracts, supporting diverse carbon credit portfolios.\n\t\t- **Oracle Networks**: [[Chainlink]] provides verified data feeds connecting blockchain carbon platforms with traditional registries, satellite monitoring systems, and IoT sensor networks. Oracles verify credit authenticity before tokenisation and provide ongoing monitoring data for permanence verification. Some platforms use multiple oracle providers for redundancy and enhanced security against data manipulation.\n\t\t- **MRV Technologies**: Satellite imagery from providers including Planet Labs and Maxar enables remote sensing of forest carbon stocks, land use changes, and project performance. IoT sensor networks measure renewable energy generation, methane capture rates, and soil carbon content. Machine learning algorithms process satellite and sensor data to automate verification, reducing human auditor requirements whilst improving accuracy and detection of fraudulent claims.\n\t\t- **Decentralised Finance (DeFi) Integration**: Automated market makers including Uniswap and SushiSwap enable decentralised carbon credit trading without centralised intermediaries. Liquidity pools allow passive investors to earn fees whilst providing market liquidity. Carbon-backed stablecoins and derivatives create sophisticated financial instruments that enable hedging, forward contracts, and indexed exposure to diversified carbon portfolios.\n\t\t- **Enterprise Integration**: APIs connect blockchain carbon platforms with corporate sustainability systems including Salesforce Sustainability Cloud, SAP Carbon Impact, and Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability. Integration with enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems enables automated carbon accounting and offset purchases tied to operational emissions data.\n\n\t- ### Challenges and Limitations\n\t\t- Oracle reliability remains a critical vulnerability for blockchain carbon systems. The integrity of on-chain carbon credits depends entirely on accurate data from oracles verifying credit authenticity and project performance. Compromised oracles could enable fraudulent credits to be tokenised or allow manipulated monitoring data to maintain credits for failed projects. Multi-oracle architectures and cryptographic verification mechanisms mitigate but don't eliminate these risks.\n\t\t- Energy consumption of blockchain networks, particularly proof-of-work systems, creates ironic climate impacts for carbon credit platforms. Early implementations on Ethereum mainnet faced criticism that transaction energy consumption negated climate benefits of the credits being traded. Migration to proof-of-stake Ethereum and use of energy-efficient networks like Polygon and Celo addresses these concerns, but public perception challenges remain.\n\t\t- Regulatory uncertainty creates adoption hesitation, particularly for compliance markets with strict legal requirements. Questions about legal status of tokenised credits, cross-border regulatory treatment, and potential securities classification create risks for platforms and users. Traditional registry operators are cautious about blockchain integration pending regulatory clarity, slowing mainstream adoption.\n\t\t- Quality variation among tokenised credits risks creating a \"race to the bottom\" where lowest-quality credits dominate due to lowest prices. Whilst blockchain enables transparent quality differentiation, market forces may drive buyers toward cheapest credits regardless of actual climate impact. Some platforms address this through quality filters and tiered token classes that separate high-integrity credits from questionable offsets.\n\t\t- Permanence monitoring for nature-based credits requires ongoing resources and governance that blockchain alone cannot provide. Whilst smart contracts can automate some permanence processes, human judgment remains necessary for assessing force majeure events, updating permanence assumptions based on new climate science, and managing buffer pools that insure against reversals. Hybrid models combining blockchain transparency with human governance are necessary but create complexity.\n\t\t- Market fragmentation across multiple blockchain platforms, token standards, and registry bridges creates interoperability challenges. A corporate buyer may need to interact with multiple platforms to access desired credit types, whilst project developers must choose platforms without clear market winners. Standardisation efforts are progressing slowly, with consolidation likely to take 5-10 years.\n\n\t- ### Future Developments\n\t\t- Integration with carbon border adjustment mechanisms including the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) will require robust carbon tracking across international supply chains. Blockchain platforms that integrate production emissions data with carbon credit retirement could automate CBAM compliance, reducing administrative burdens whilst ensuring environmental integrity. This integration could substantially expand blockchain carbon tracking beyond voluntary offset markets into mainstream trade flows.\n\t\t- Artificial intelligence integration will enhance monitoring, reporting, and verification processes. Machine learning algorithms analysing satellite imagery, sensor data, and project documentation can detect anomalies indicating fraud or performance issues, flagging them for human review. AI-powered carbon quantification could reduce uncertainty ranges in emission reduction estimates, increasing credit credibility and value.\n\t\t- Tokenisation of nature-based solutions including blue carbon from mangrove restoration, soil carbon from regenerative agriculture, and biodiversity credits from conservation projects will expand beyond traditional forestry credits. These diverse carbon assets require sophisticated verification and permanence monitoring that blockchain platforms are developing. The market for nature-based credits could grow from current $500 million to over $10 billion by 2030.\n\t\t- Integration with decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs) may create community-governed carbon markets with transparent decision-making about methodology updates, credit quality standards, and market rules. DAO governance could address criticisms of opaque standard-setting processes in traditional registries whilst enabling rapid evolution to address emerging challenges and opportunities.\n\t\t- Real-time carbon accounting enabled by blockchain integration with IoT sensors and enterprise systems will shift from annual carbon inventories to continuous monitoring and offsetting. Smart contracts that automatically purchase and retire credits based on real-time emissions data could enable true carbon neutrality rather than backward-looking annual reconciliation. Several corporations are piloting these systems with projections that 30-50% of voluntary carbon demand could shift to real-time models by 2030.\n\n\t- #\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable\n\n\n## References\n\t\t- [[BC-0266-sustainability]]\n\t\t- [[BC-0449-circular-economy]]\n\t\t- [[BC-0025-smart-contracts]]\n\t\t- [[BC-0151-tokenisation]]\n\t\t- [[BC-0440-supply-chain-traceability]]\n\t\t- [[Verra VCS]]\n\t\t- [[Gold Standard]]\n\t\t- [[Paris Agreement]]\n\t\t- [[Ethereum]]\n\t\t- [[Polygon]]\n\t\t- [[Chainlink]]\n\t\t- [[ERC-20]]\n\t\t- [[Decentralised Finance]]",
