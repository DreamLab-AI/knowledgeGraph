(from offer letter, checking that is this years)\n- I need to repay £3644.76 by July, from the moment I put the timesheet in on Friday.\n- Pension is the less good one, I won’t bother with it\n- full 12 month probation so they can fire you whenever, but you need to work 3 months\n- ## The Unitemps terms\n- Pay works out to £42k ish I think for the full year, when set to spinal point 36 (robbery)\n- Loss of some protections\n- Right to simply leave whenever\n- Option for overtime is there but required a new form from Andy and would likely mean negotiating a cap?\n- To bring the Unitemps offer in line with the core contract requires 15 additional days (I think, might be as high as 20)\n- After those days it’s “profit” assuming you had to work an extra day a week anyway\n- No pension\n- ## Other options\n- I can sell them 10 tripods and heads for £360 each, which is actually pretty decent second hand rate. I will throw in an old vicon multi head bonita system I picked up (no licenses but all working)\n- I would accept two RTX 4090 GPUs and a crosslink from whatever channels / partner, and this would enable us to do more serious BF16 training which I can’t currently do.\n- I can simply carry on doing contract work?\n- ## Claude Says\n  \n  Assumptions:\n- Employment Contract: 32 days of holiday per year\n- Temporary Assignment: 28 days of holiday per year (pro-rata)\n- Temporary Assignment holiday pay rates: £2.83 per hour for the first 12 weeks, £3.65 per hour thereafter\n  \n  Calculations:\n- Employment Contract:\n\t- Annual salary: £44,623\n\t- Effective annual salary (with holiday): £44,623 (no change)\n- Temporary Assignment:\n\t- Hourly rate: £23.48\n\t- Hours worked per week: 36.25\n\t- Weeks worked per year (assuming 28 days of holiday): 47.4 weeks\n\t- Annual salary (excluding holiday pay): £40,318.85 (36.25 hours/week × £23.48/hour × 47.4 weeks)\n\t- Holiday pay for first 12 weeks: £1,232.67 (36.25 hours/week × £2.83/hour × 12 weeks)\n\t- Holiday pay for remaining 4.6 weeks: £608.41 (36.25 hours/week × £3.65/hour × 4.6 weeks)\n\t- Total annual salary (including holiday pay): £42,159.93 (£40,318.85 + £1,232.67 + £608.41)\n\t  \n\t  Comparison Table (updated):\n\t  \n\t  | \n\t  | Feature | \n\t  | Employment Contract | \n\t  | Temporary Assignment | \n\t  |\n\t  \n\t  | ---- |\n\t  \n\t  | \n\t  | Duration | \n\t  | 12 months (18/03/2024\n\t - 30/03/2025) | \n\t  | 12 months (assumed) | \n\t  |\n\t  \n\t  | \n\t  | Effective Annual Salary (with holiday) | \n\t  | £44,623 | \n\t  | £42,159.93 | \n\t  |\n\t  \n\t  | \n\t  | Working Hours | \n\t  | Full-time (hours not specified) | \n\t  | 36.25 hours per week | \n\t  |\n\t  \n\t  | \n\t  | Holiday Entitlement | \n\t  | 32 days per year plus public holidays and closure days | \n\t  | 28 days per year (pro-rata), paid at £2.83 per hour for the first 12 weeks, then £3.65 per hour | \n\t  |\n\t  \n\t  | \n\t  | Pension | \n\t  | Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) | \n\t  | Eligible for pension if earnings exceed £833/month (average over 3 months) | \n\t  |\n\t  \n\t  | \n\t  | Probation Period | \n\t  | 12 months | \n\t  | Not specified | \n\t  |\n\t  \n\t  | \n\t  | Notice Period | \n\t  | 3 months (after probation) | \n\t  | No formal notice period | \n\t  |\n\t  \n\t  | \n\t  | Additional Benefits | \n\t  | Not specified | \n\t  | Eye care vouchers, staff parking rates, access to university facilities and training | \n\t  |\n\t  \n\t  Key Differences (updated):\n- The effective annual salary for the temporary assignment (£42,159.93) is lower than the employment contract (£44,623) when considering holiday pay on a pro-rata basis.\n- The employment contract includes a 12-month probationary period and a 3-month notice period, whereas the temporary assignment has no formal probation or notice periods.\n- The temporary assignment offers additional benefits such as eye care vouchers, staff parking rates, and access to university facilities, which are not mentioned in the employment contract.\n  \n  In summary, when assuming all leave is taken and accounting for the two holiday pay rates on a pro-rata basis, the temporary assignment results in a lower effective annual salary compared to the employment contract. The employment contract offers a more stable income and longer holiday entitlement, while the temporary assignment provides additional benefits and flexibility. Your decision should be based on your personal preferences, long-term career goals, and the importance of a higher, stable income versus the additional benefits and flexibility offered by the temporary assignment.\n  \n  <!-- notionvc: 897810d9-4c22-49c9-98be-39853802358a -->\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
