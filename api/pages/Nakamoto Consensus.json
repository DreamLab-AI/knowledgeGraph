Contrary to the theory, their findings do not support a trend towards homogenization. Instead, some indicators suggest weak trends of deconcentration in voting behavior, indicating diverse preferences [(Budzinski & Pannicke, 2017)](https://consensus.app/papers/preferences-music-converge-across-countries-empirical-budzinski/4baf26344e6c5f62a89851a45f2e8ee9/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\t- **Consumer Behavior Heterogeneity**: Mooij and Hofstede (2002) argue that converging technology and income levels will not lead to a homogenization of consumer behavior. Cultural differences will likely cause consumer behavior to become more heterogeneous, emphasizing the importance of understanding national cultural values and their impact on behavior [(Mooij & Hofstede, 2002)](https://consensus.app/papers/convergence-divergence-consumer-behavior-implications-mooij/0fdf7549d4ed5a10b4e67469115c83e6/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\t- **Digital Culture and Education**: Kultaieva (2020) discusses the impact of digital culture on communication and self-recognition in post-industrial societies. The paper highlights the changes in communication forms within digital culture, emphasizing visual culture over traditional writing culture [(Kultaieva, 2020)](https://consensus.app/papers/homo-digitalis-digital-culture-digital-education-kultaieva/f44183f43b2c5fb79e12fbea03e1804d/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\t- **Algorithmic Consumer Culture**: Airoldi and Rokka (2022) conceptualize algorithmic consumer culture, exploring how the opacity, authority, non-neutrality, and recursivity of algorithms affect consumer culture at various levels. This provides insights into how digitalization and big data surveillance practices shape consumption patterns [(Airoldi & Rokka, 2022)](https://consensus.app/papers/consumer-culture-airoldi/d2cfefc419485f6286ce2e4ca9d165bf/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\t- **Cultural Homogenization and Technology**: Fairweather and Rogerson (2003) discuss the implications of global cultural homogenization in a technologically dependent world, examining how information and communication technologies contribute to this process [(Fairweather & Rogerson, 2003)](https://consensus.app/papers/problems-homogenisation-technologically-world-fairweather/906e1d758b775c2a963acc4d52438a94/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\t- **Cultural Consequences of Globalization**: Holton (2000) analyzes cultural consequences of globalization, discussing homogenization, polarization, and hybridization theses. The study suggests that global culture is not becoming entirely standardized around Western patterns, highlighting cultural alternatives and resistance [(Holton, 2000)](https://consensus.app/papers/globalizations-cultural-consequences-holton/ecdfbc4c728d55378e11dd54e01fe806/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\t- [Filterworld: How Algorithms Flattened Culture: Chayka, Kyle: 9780385548281: Amazon.com: Books](https://www.amazon.com/Filterworld-How-Algorithms-Flattened-Culture/dp/0385548281)\n\n\t\t- ##### No agreed measurable end goal\n\t\t\t- Bitcoin is a game theoretic juggernaut, where success of the network breeds more success for the network.
