(2025). \"Trust, Trustworthiness, and the Future of Medical AI.\" *Journal of Medical Internet Research*, 27(1), e71236. DOI: 10.2196/71236.\n  - The University of Melbourne & KPMG International (2025). \"Trust, attitudes and use of artificial intelligence: A global study 2025.\" DOI: 10.26188/28822919.\n  - Smuha, S., et al. (2024). \"Legally Trustworthy AI: Pillars and Frameworks.\" *European AI Law Review*, 3(2), 45-67.\n- Ongoing research explores improving AI transparency, accountability mechanisms, fairness metrics, and integrating human oversight to address emerging ethical and technical challenges.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK has been proactive in AI ethics and trustworthiness, with government initiatives and research centres promoting responsible AI.\n- North England hosts several innovation hubs focusing on trustworthy AI:\n  - Manchester’s AI research institutes collaborate with industry to develop transparent and fair AI systems.\n  - Leeds and Sheffield contribute through interdisciplinary projects linking AI ethics with social impact.\n  - Newcastle is notable for work on AI robustness and safety in critical infrastructure.\n- Regional case studies include public sector AI deployments in healthcare and transport, emphasising accountability and privacy compliance in line with UK and EU regulations.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include:\n  - Greater integration of AI trustworthiness into regulatory frameworks beyond the EU, influencing UK policy post-Brexit.\n  - Advances in explainable AI (XAI) techniques to reduce opacity in complex models.\n  - Enhanced AI lifecycle governance incorporating continuous risk assessment and stakeholder engagement.\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Balancing innovation speed with rigorous trustworthiness standards.\n  - Addressing biases embedded in training data and algorithms.\n  - Ensuring equitable AI benefits across diverse populations.\n- Research priorities focus on scalable transparency methods, legal accountability frameworks, and socio-technical approaches to embed trustworthiness in AI design and deployment.\n\n## References\n\n1.
