height: 600px\"></iframe>\n- Created by researcher-artists Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler, it aims to contextualise current developments in [[Artificial Intelligence]] by examining how technology and power structures have [co-evolved over five centuries](https://www.e-flux.com/announcements/573730/calculating-empires/)\n- <iframe src=\"https://knowingmachines.org/research\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 600px\"></iframe>\n- The centerpiece of the exhibition is the [Calculating Empires Map Room](https://knowingmachines.org/publications/calculating-empires), which features two massive 12-meter long maps.\n- One map focuses on communication and computation, covering the evolution of communication devices, interfaces, data practices, and computational architectures.\n- The other map explores control and classification, examining how technologies have been integrated into social systems of [[Digital Society Surveillance]] , [[Education and AI]] , colonialism, [[Cyber Security and Military]]\n- It starts in the 1500s, examining pivotal developments like the Gutenberg printing press and new maritime trade routes that expanded European [[Politics, Law, Privacy]]\n- It takes a long-term view to reveal recurring patterns in how technology and power structures have developed over centuries.\n- The visual style is inspired by sources like [Aby Warburg's \"Atlas\" project](https://warburg.library.cornell.edu/about/), using evocative imagery to trace historical evolutions.\n- It aims to provide critical perspective on current AI developments by placing them in a broader historical context of technological power.\n- The exhibition also includes a recreation of the creators' earlier work \"[Anatomy of an AI System\"](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/401279).\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
