Unlike [[Proof of Work]] (PoW), which requires extensive [[computational power]] and [[energy consumption]], PoS replaces computational work with economic stake, making it significantly more [[energy-efficient]] while maintaining [[network security]] through economic incentives.\n\n- ## Core Definition and Principles\n\t- ### Fundamental Concept\n\t\t- **Economic Security Model**: PoS secures [[blockchain networks]] through [[economic incentives]] rather than computational difficulty\n\t\t- **Validator Selection**: [[Network participants]] are chosen to propose and validate [[blocks]] based on their staked [[tokens]]\n\t\t- **Stake as Collateral**: [[Validators]] must lock up [[cryptocurrency]] as security deposit, which can be forfeited ([[slashing]]) for malicious behavior\n\t\t- **Energy Efficiency**: Eliminates the need for energy-intensive [[mining]] operations required by [[Proof of Work]]\n\t\t- **Accessibility**: Lowers [[barriers to entry]] compared to PoW [[mining]], requiring [[capital investment]] rather than specialized [[hardware]]\n\n\t- ### Historical Development\n\t\t- **2011**: First PoS concept proposed as alternative to [[Bitcoin]]'s [[Proof of Work]]\n\t\t- **2012**: [[Peercoin]] becomes first [[cryptocurrency]] to implement PoS alongside PoW (hybrid model)\n\t\t- **2014**: [[Ethereum]] announces plans to transition from PoW to PoS in its [[roadmap]]\n\t\t- **2017**: [[Cardano]] launches with [[Ouroboros]] PoS [[protocol]]\n\t\t- **2020**: [[Ethereum]] launches [[Beacon Chain]], beginning multi-year transition to PoS\n\t\t- **2022**: [[Ethereum Merge]] completes, transitioning [[Ethereum]] from PoW to PoS (99.95% [[energy reduction]])\n\t\t- **2025**: PoS becomes dominant [[consensus mechanism]] for major [[blockchain platforms]]\n\n- ## Proof of Stake Mechanisms\n\t- ### Validator Selection Methods\n\t\t- **Random Selection**\n\t\t\t- [[Validators]] chosen pseudo-randomly using [[verifiable random functions]] (VRFs)\n\t\t\t- Selection probability weighted by [[stake amount]]\n\t\t\t- Used by [[Ethereum]] ([[Casper FFG]]), [[Cardano]] ([[Ouroboros]])\n\t\t\t- Prevents predictability and [[validator manipulation]]\n\n\t\t- **Age-Weighted Selection**\n\t\t\t- Considers both [[stake amount]] and [[staking duration]] (coin age)\n\t\t\t- Older stakes have higher selection probability\n\t\t\t- Implemented in early PoS systems like [[Peercoin]]\n\t\t\t- Encourages long-term [[network participation]]\n\n\t\t- **Delegated Selection**\n\t\t\t- [[Token holders]] vote for [[delegates]] who become [[validators]]\n\t\t\t- Fixed number of active [[validators]] (e.g., 21-101 delegates)\n\t\t\t- Used in [[Delegated Proof of Stake]] (DPoS) systems\n\t\t\t- Examples: [[EOS]], [[Tron]], [[Lisk]]\n\n\t\t- **Nominated Selection**\n\t\t\t- [[Nominators]] select trusted [[validators]] and stake with them\n\t\t\t- [[Validators]] compete for [[nominations]] based on [[reputation]] and [[commission rates]]\n\t\t\t- Implemented in [[Polkadot]]'s [[Nominated Proof of Stake]] (NPoS)\n\t\t\t- Combines [[decentralization]] with [[security]]\n\n\t- ### Consensus Finality\n\t\t- **Probabilistic Finality**\n\t\t\t- [[Transaction]] finality increases over time with each new [[block]]\n\t\t\t- Similar to [[Bitcoin]]'s confirmation model but faster\n\t\t\t- Lower [[security guarantees]] but higher [[throughput]]\n\n\t\t- **Deterministic Finality**\n\t\t\t- [[Transactions]] are immediately final once confirmed\n\t\t\t- Implemented through [[Byzantine Fault Tolerant]] (BFT) [[consensus]]\n\t\t\t- Examples: [[Tendermint]] ([[Cosmos]]), [[Casper FFG]] ([[Ethereum]])\n\t\t\t- Higher [[security]] but potentially lower [[throughput]]\n\n\t\t- **Economic Finality**\n\t\t\t- Reverting finalized [[blocks]] becomes economically irrational\n\t\t\t- Cost to attack exceeds potential gains\n\t\t\t- Core security assumption of [[Ethereum]]'s [[Casper]]\n\n- ##
