### Brief history and development\n    - Sheffield’s manufacturing heritage dates back to the Industrial Revolution, with a global reputation for steel and toolmaking, driven by local geology and abundant natural resources.\n    - The decline of traditional industries in the late 20th century led to regeneration efforts, culminating in the creation of the Advanced Manufacturing Park (AMP) in 2001 on the former Orgreave Colliery site.\n    - The AMP was established as a response to the need for economic renewal, leveraging partnerships between academia and industry.\n  - ### Current state and infrastructure\n    - The AMP is a 150-acre (61 ha) technology park in Waverley, Rotherham, South Yorkshire, serving as the heart of the Advanced Manufacturing Innovation District (AMID).\n    - The site hosts a cluster of advanced manufacturing facilities, research centres, and business incubators, transforming former industrial brownfield land into a modern innovation hub.\n  - ### Key organisations and institutions\n    - University of Sheffield Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC)\n    - Nuclear AMRC\n    - Apprentice Training Centre\n    - Royce Translational Centre\n    - Laboratory for Verification and Validation\n    - Integrated Civil and Infrastructure Research Centre\n    - South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority\n\n- ## Technology Focus\n  - ### Primary technology sectors\n    - Advanced manufacturing\n    - Materials science (including speciality steels and alloys)\n    - Robotics and automation\n    - Aerospace and automotive engineering\n    - Nuclear and energy technologies\n  - ### Notable companies and startups\n    - Boeing (first European production facility)\n    - Rolls-Royce\n    - McLaren\n    - Tinsley Bridge (specialises in automotive, energy, steel, nuclear, defence, and rail sectors)\n    - Technicut (early collaborator with AMRC)\n  - ### Research institutions and universities\n    - University of Sheffield (leading research and investment in engineering)\n    - AMRC and affiliated centres\n    - Collaboration with national and international research bodies\n  - ### Innovation programmes\n    - AMRC’s R&D partnerships with public and private sector organisations\n    - Aerospace Technology Institute programme\n    - Teaching Company Scheme (early government-funded industry-academia collaboration)\n    - SME support and technology transfer initiatives\n\n- ## Economic Impact\n  - ### Employment and growth\n    - The AMRC supports over 520 high-value, high-productivity jobs (2021/22).\n    - The wider AMID ecosystem attracts significant inward investment and creates employment across advanced manufacturing and related sectors.\n    - On average, the AMRC provides innovation and technology support to more than 1,100 businesses annually, with 42% being SMEs.\n  - ### Investment and funding\n    - Major funding from government, European Regional Development Fund, Innovate UK, EPSRC, and industry partners.\n    - Over £70m government and £70m European funding received by AMRC up to 2015.\n    - Continued investment through the South Yorkshire Investment Zone and local enterprise partnerships.\n  - ### Regional contribution\n    - The AMRC is a key attractor of foreign direct investment (FDI) and a central part of South Yorkshire’s economic pitch.\n    - The regeneration of the AMP has helped the region transition from traditional heavy industry to a knowledge-based, advanced manufacturing economy.\n\n- ## Notable Projects\n  - ### Specific examples of innovation\n    - Development of the parabolic leaf spring by Tinsley Bridge, now used in over 80% of global truck suspensions.\n    - Boeing’s European research and production facility at AMP.\n    - Rolls-Royce and McLaren establishing advanced manufacturing facilities in the region.\n  - ### Success stories\n    - Transformation of the Orgreave Colliery site into a world-class advanced manufacturing campus.\n    - AMRC’s role in supporting over 1,100 businesses annually and driving SME innovation.\n  - ### Collaborative initiatives\n    - AMRC’s partnership with Boeing, Rolls-Royce, and McLaren.\n    - Joint R&D projects between the University of Sheffield and industry leaders.\n    - South Yorkshire Investment Zone, co-funded by industry and government.\n\n- ## Future Development\n  - ### Growth plans and strategies\n    - Expansion of the AMID as the UK’s largest research-led advanced manufacturing cluster.\n    - Continued focus on attracting global investment and fostering innovation in advanced manufacturing, materials, and robotics.\n  - ### Infrastructure investments\n    - Ongoing development of research facilities, business incubators, and advanced manufacturing infrastructure.\n    - Investment in skills and apprenticeship programmes to support workforce development.\n  - ### Policy support\n    - Support from the South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority and national government.\n    - Designation as the UK’s first Investment Zone, providing targeted incentives for advanced manufacturing and innovation.\n\n\n## Related Hubs\n\n- [[North England Innovation Corridor]]\n- [[Northern Powerhouse]]\n- [[UK Tech Ecosystem]]\n\n\n\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  -
