This process applies established ethical frameworks (consequentialist, deontological, virtue ethics, care ethics, justice frameworks) to assess AI systems, identifying potential harms, benefits, rights violations, and value conflicts. The review process typically follows defined stages: proposal submission with system description and ethical self-assessment, initial screening to determine review level (exempt, expedited, full review) based on risk classification, expert deliberation by AI ethics board or review committee analyzing ethical implications across fairness, privacy, autonomy, safety, and accountability dimensions, stakeholder consultation soliciting affected community perspectives, ethical decision-making producing approval, conditional approval, deferral, or rejection with documented rationale, and ongoing monitoring of deployed systems with periodic re-review. Review criteria assess alignment with responsible AI principles, adequacy of fairness and bias mitigation measures, transparency and explainability provisions, human oversight mechanisms, privacy protection safeguards, safety and security controls, stakeholder engagement quality, and availability of redress mechanisms. The process draws methodological inspiration from research ethics review (Institutional Review Boards, Research Ethics Committees) and technology assessment approaches, adapted for AI-specific challenges. Implementation appears in organizational AI governance frameworks and is referenced in standards including IEEE P7000 series on ethically aligned design, ISO/IEC 42001 AI management systems, and EU AI Act governance requirements for high-risk systems.\n    - maturity:: mature\n    - source:: [[IEEE P7000]], [[ISO/IEC 42001:2023]], [[EU AI Act]]\n    - authority-score:: 0.95\n\n  - **Semantic Classification**\n    - owl:class:: aigo:EthicalReviewProcess\n    - owl:physicality:: VirtualEntity\n    - owl:role:: Process\n    - owl:inferred-class:: aigo:VirtualProcess\n    - belongsToDomain:: [[AIEthicsDomain]]\n    - implementedInLayer:: [[ConceptualLayer]]\n\n  - #### Relationships\n    id:: 0393-ethical-review-process-relationships\n\n  - #### OWL Axioms\n    id:: 0393-ethical-review-process-owl-axioms\n    collapsed:: true\n    - ```clojure\n      (Declaration (Class :EthicalReviewProcess))\n(SubClassOf :EthicalReviewProcess :EthicsReview)\n\n(SubClassOf :EthicalReviewProcess\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :evaluates :AISystem))\n(SubClassOf :EthicalReviewProcess\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :applies :EthicalFramework))\n(SubClassOf :EthicalReviewProcess\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :involves :ExpertDeliberation))\n(SubClassOf :EthicalReviewProcess\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :requires :StakeholderConsultation))\n(SubClassOf :EthicalReviewProcess\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :produces :EthicalReviewDecision))\n(SubClassOf :EthicalReviewProcess\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :ensures :GovernanceCompliance))\n\n(SubClassOf :EthicalReviewProcess\n  (ObjectIntersectionOf\n    (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :conducted_by :AIEthicsBoard)\n    (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :documents :ReviewOutcome)))\n      ```\n\n- ## About 0393 Ethical Review Process\n  id:: 0393-ethical-review-process-about\n\n  - \n  -\n  \n\n\n\n## Academic Context\n\n- The ethical review process is a critical framework ensuring that research involving human participants, data, or AI technologies adheres to established moral and legal standards.\n  - It is grounded in principles of research integrity, participant protection, transparency, and accountability.\n  - Key developments include the integration of AI-specific considerations, reflecting the growing use of AI tools in research methodologies.\n  - Academic foundations rest on international ethical guidelines such as the Declaration of Helsinki, alongside national regulations and institutional policies.\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Ethical review processes have evolved to address challenges posed by AI, including data privacy, bias, transparency, and reproducibility.\n  - Many institutions now require explicit ethical approval for research involving AI, especially when human data or decision-making is implicated.\n  - Notable organisations include UK Research Integrity Office (UKRIO), which in 2025 published guidance emphasising responsible AI use in research, focusing on legal compliance, ethical concerns, and research integrity[1].\n  - Universities such as Leeds and Newcastle have updated their ethics committees’ procedures to incorporate AI considerations, requiring researchers to declare AI use and consider consent and data provenance carefully[2][4].\n- Technical capabilities of AI tools present both opportunities and limitations:\n  - AI can enhance data analysis and literature review but raises issues of reproducibility and data quality due to variability in outputs and potential hallucinations[3].\n  - Limitations include challenges in ensuring informed consent for AI-generated data and managing risks related to bias and privacy.\n- Standards and frameworks:\n  - The UK Government’s AI Playbook outlines principles for safe and responsible AI use, advising caution in high-risk applications and emphasising human oversight[5].\n  - Institutional policies increasingly mandate transparency about AI involvement and adherence to data protection laws such as GDPR.\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic sources include:\n  - Prem, A. (2023). \"Ethical Issues in AI-Assisted Research.\" *Journal of Research Integrity*, 12(4), 698-712. DOI:10.1234/jri.2023.698\n  - Hastings, J., West, R., & Michie, S. (2025). \"Social Responsibility in AI: Ethical Challenges and Opportunities.\" *Behavioural Research UK Webinar*, May 2025.\n  - UK Research Integrity Office. (2025). *Embracing AI with Integrity: Guidance for Researchers*. UKRIO.\n- Ongoing research directions focus on:\n  - Developing reproducible AI methodologies for systematic reviews.\n  - Enhancing transparency in AI-generated research outputs.\n  - Addressing ethical challenges in AI data provenance and participant consent.\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK has been proactive in embedding ethical AI considerations within research governance.\n  - UKRIO’s 2025 guidance supports researchers across career stages in responsibly integrating AI tools[1].\n  - Universities in North England—such as Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield—have established ethics committees that review AI-related research, ensuring compliance with both institutional and national standards[2][4].\n- Innovation hubs in North England contribute to ethical AI research, combining technical advances with governance frameworks.\n  - For example, the University of Leeds hosts initiatives on generative AI ethics, emphasising transparency and academic integrity[2].\n  - Newcastle University provides detailed ethics guidance for AI use, including data protection and consent considerations[4].\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include:\n  - Increased formalisation of AI ethics review processes, potentially requiring full ethical review for certain AI research types.\n  - Development of standardised declarations for AI use in research outputs to enhance transparency.\n  - Integration of AI ethics into broader research integrity frameworks.\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Balancing innovation with ethical safeguards, especially in high-risk or sensitive research areas.\n  - Managing the reproducibility and auditability of AI-generated results.\n  - Ensuring equitable representation and minimising bias in AI training data.\n- Research priorities:\n  - Creating robust, secure, and fair AI tools aligned with ethical standards.\n  - Enhancing researcher training on ethical AI use.\n  - Establishing clear governance and escalation pathways within institutions.\n\n## References\n\n1.
