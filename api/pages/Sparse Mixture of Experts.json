Sparsely-gated MoE enables models with up to 137 billion parameters with manageable inference costs.\n\n\n\n## Academic Context\n\n- Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) is a neural network architecture that partitions a model into multiple expert sub-networks, each specialising in different aspects of the input data.\n  - A trainable gating network (router) selects a sparse subset of these experts for each input, enabling conditional computation.\n  - This approach dramatically increases model capacity while maintaining computational efficiency by activating only a fraction of the model’s parameters per example.\n- The foundational concept dates back to Jacobs et al. (1991) with \"Adaptive Mixture of Local Experts,\" which introduced training both experts and a gating network jointly.\n- SMoE has become a key technique in scaling large language models (LLMs) and vision models, balancing the trade-off between model size and inference cost.\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- SMoE architectures are widely adopted in industry to build models with tens to hundreds of billions of parameters without proportional increases in computational cost.\n  - Leading AI research labs and companies deploy SMoE in natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and multimodal tasks.\n  - Examples include Mistral’s Mixtral 8x7B and Google’s V-MoE for vision, which achieve state-of-the-art performance with reduced resource consumption.\n- Technical capabilities:\n  - SMoE enables models with parameter counts exceeding 100 billion while keeping FLOPs (floating point operations) per token manageable.\n  - Challenges remain in training stability, such as representation collapse, which recent algorithms like SimSMoE address by encouraging diversity among experts.\n- Standards and frameworks:\n  - SMoE layers typically replace feed-forward networks in Transformer blocks.\n  - Sparse activation is implemented via top-k expert selection by the gating network.\n  - Open-source toolkits and pre-trained models facilitate adoption and experimentation.\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers:\n  - Jacobs, R.
