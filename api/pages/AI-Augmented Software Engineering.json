It represents a collaborative paradigm wherein [[AI Systems]] assist with [[Code Generation]], [[Automated Testing]], [[Debugging]], and [[Deployment]] whilst developers retain strategic decision-making authority and domain expertise[2].\n\nThis approach fundamentally differs from [[Autonomous Software Development]], instead emphasizing **[[Human-AI Collaboration]]** where [[AI Systems]] function as intelligent assistants, amplifying developer productivity through [[Generative AI]], [[Large Language Models]], [[Neural Code Generation]], and [[Machine Learning]] algorithms integrated into the [[Software Development Lifecycle]][1][3]. Contemporary implementations leverage [[AI Safety Research]], [[Value Alignment]], and [[Constitutional AI]] principles to ensure responsible development practices.\n\n## Current State and Implementations (2024-2025)\n\n### Market Overview [Updated 2025]\n\nThe field has achieved substantial market maturity and commercial adoption.
