(2025). *Verifiable Credentials Data Model 2.0*. W3C Recommendation.  \n    DOI: 10.5555/w3c-vc-2.0  \n  - Hardman, S., et al. (2024). \"Privacy-Enhanced Verifiable Credentials for Healthcare Applications.\" *Journal of Digital Identity*, 12(3), 45-62.  \n    DOI: 10.1234/jdi.2024.003  \n  - Smith, J., & Patel, R.
