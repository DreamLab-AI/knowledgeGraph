Real-time inference guarantees P99 latency below 10-100ms depending on application requirements, supporting 60+ frames-per-second video processing for autonomous vehicle perception or sub-millisecond control loops for robotic systems. The architecture implements hard real-time constraints with priority scheduling, ensuring critical inference tasks always meet timing deadlines regardless of system load or competing workloads. Hardware acceleration through NPUs (Neural Processing Units), FPGAs, or specialized ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) enables real-time performance by offloading computation from energy-hungry CPUs. Real-time systems employ overlapping computation and I/O through techniques like CUDA streams, pipelined inference, and speculative execution to maximize throughput while meeting latency bounds. The challenge extends beyond single-inference latency to end-to-end system latency: sensor acquisition, preprocessing, model inference, postprocessing, and actuator control must complete within strict timeframes. Applications include autonomous vehicle LIDAR/camera perception for obstacle detection, industrial robotic arm control, drone flight stabilization, and medical device monitoring. Safety-critical deployments follow standards like AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform and IEC 61508 (Functional Safety), requiring formal timing verification. Real-time edge inference represents the convergence of embedded systems predictability with modern deep learning, enabling autonomous intelligence that responds to dynamic environments within millisecond deadlines.\n    - maturity:: mature\n    - source:: \n    - authority-score:: 0.95\n\n  - **Semantic Classification**\n    - owl:class:: aigo:RealTimeInferenceAtEdge\n    - owl:physicality:: VirtualEntity\n    - owl:role:: Process\n    - owl:inferred-class:: aigo:VirtualProcess\n    - belongsToDomain:: [[AIEthicsDomain]]\n    - implementedInLayer:: [[ConceptualLayer]]\n\n  - #### Relationships\n    id:: real-time-inference-at-edge-(ai-0439)-relationships\n\n  - #### OWL Axioms\n    id:: real-time-inference-at-edge-(ai-0439)-owl-axioms\n    collapsed:: true\n    - ```clojure\n      (Declaration (Class :RealTimeInferenceAtEdge))\n(AnnotationAssertion rdfs:label :RealTimeInferenceAtEdge \"Real-Time Inference at Edge\"@en)\n(SubClassOf :RealTimeInferenceAtEdge :AIGovernancePrinciple)\n(SubClassOf :RealTimeInferenceAtEdge :RealTimeSystem)\n\n;; Latency Requirements\n(SubClassOf :RealTimeInferenceAtEdge\n  (DataSomeValuesFrom :hasMaxLatencyMS (DatatypeRestriction xsd:integer (xsd:maxInclusive \"100\"))))\n(SubClassOf :RealTimeInferenceAtEdge\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :guarantees :DeterministicExecution))\n\n;; Real-Time Constraints\n(SubClassOf :RealTimeInferenceAtEdge\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :requires :HardDeadlines))\n(SubClassOf :RealTimeInferenceAtEdge\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :implements :PriorityScheduling))\n\n;; Performance Metrics\n(DataPropertyAssertion :hasP99LatencyMS :RealTimeInferenceAtEdge \"10\"^^xsd:integer)\n(DataPropertyAssertion :hasJitterMS :RealTimeInferenceAtEdge \"2\"^^xsd:integer)\n(DataPropertyAssertion :hasThroughputFPS :RealTimeInferenceAtEdge \"60\"^^xsd:integer)\n\n;; Hardware Optimization\n(SubClassOf :RealTimeInferenceAtEdge\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :utilizesAccelerator :NeuralProcessingUnit))\n(SubClassOf :RealTimeInferenceAtEdge\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :utilizesAccelerator :FPGA))\n\n;; Standards Reference\n(AnnotationAssertion rdfs:seeAlso :RealTimeInferenceAtEdge\n  \"AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform - ML Inference\")\n(AnnotationAssertion rdfs:seeAlso :RealTimeInferenceAtEdge\n  \"IEC 61508 - Functional Safety\")\n      ```\n\n- ## About Real-Time Inference at Edge (AI-0439)\n  id:: real-time-inference-at-edge-(ai-0439)-about\n\n  - \n  -\n    - ### Implementation Patterns\n  - ### Pattern 1: Autonomous Vehicle Perception\n    ```cpp\n    /*\n     * Real-time object detection for ADAS\n     * Hardware: NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier (512 CUDA cores)\n     * Model: YOLOv7-Tiny (TensorRT optimized)\n     * Requirement: < 33ms per frame @ 30 FPS\n     * Safety standard: ISO 26262 ASIL-D\n     */\n    #include <NvInfer.h>\n    #include <cuda_runtime.h>\n  -\n    class RealTimeObjectDetector {\n    private:\n        nvinfer1::ICudaEngine* engine_;\n        nvinfer1::IExecutionContext* context_;\n        cudaStream_t cuda_stream_;\n  -\n    public:\n        struct Detection {\n            float x, y, w, h;\n            int class_id;\n            float confidence;\n        };\n  -\n        // HARD REAL-TIME: Must complete within 33ms\n        std::vector<Detection> detect_objects(const cv::Mat& frame) {\n            auto start = std::chrono::steady_clock::now();\n  -\n            // 1.
