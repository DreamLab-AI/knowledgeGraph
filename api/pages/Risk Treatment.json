Available at: https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework. Foundational voluntary framework released 26 January 2023, developed through consensus-driven, open, transparent, collaborative process[5]\n  - National Institute of Standards and Technology (2024). \"Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework: Generative Artificial Intelligence Profile (NIST-AI-600-1)\". Released 26 July 2024. Addresses unique risks from large language models and generative systems with sector-specific guidance[5]\n  - SANS Institute. \"SANS Draft Critical AI Security Guidelines v1.1\". Outlines risk-based approach to AI controls and governance, emphasising integration of technical controls with governance and compliance frameworks[6]\n  - European Commission. \"EU AI Act\". Regulatory framework classifying AI systems by risk level and requiring compliance through documentation, transparency, and human oversight mechanisms[1]\n- Ongoing research directions\n  - Quantification of ecosystem-level and reputational harms remains an active research area\n  - Integration of explainability and bias detection tools into risk treatment workflows\n  - Development of sector-specific risk treatment profiles beyond fintech and healthcare\n\n## UK Context\n\n- British contributions and implementations\n  - UK organisations increasingly adopt NIST frameworks alongside EU AI Act compliance requirements, creating dual-framework governance structures\n  - The Alan Turing Institute (London) conducts research on responsible AI and risk management, though regional distribution of AI governance expertise remains concentrated in South East England\n- North England innovation hubs\n  - Manchester's fintech community engages with risk treatment protocols, particularly regarding algorithmic bias in lending and payment systems\n  - Leeds Digital Innovation Centre and Sheffield's advanced manufacturing sector explore AI risk treatment in industrial applications, though formal case studies remain limited\n  - Newcastle University's School of Computing conducts research on AI trustworthiness, contributing to regional capability development\n- Regional considerations\n  - North England organisations often lack dedicated AI governance resources compared to London-based counterparts, creating implementation challenges for smaller enterprises\n  - Regional universities increasingly partner with local industry to develop contextualised risk treatment approaches\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends and developments\n  - Shift from reactive risk management to predictive risk identification through continuous monitoring and anomaly detection[2]\n  - Integration of AI-driven risk mitigation into existing enterprise risk management systems rather than siloed AI governance structures\n  - Development of real-time threat detection capabilities and automated incident response protocols[2]\n  - Expansion of generative AI-specific risk treatment guidance as LLM deployment accelerates across sectors\n- Anticipated challenges\n  - Balancing automation of risk assessment with necessary human oversight and validation\n  - Addressing risks that emerge from AI system interactions and ecosystem-level effects\n  - Maintaining compliance across multiple regulatory regimes (EU AI Act, sector-specific regulations, organisational policies)\n  - Scaling risk treatment practices across organisations lacking dedicated AI governance expertise, particularly in North England\n- Research priorities\n  - Development of standardised metrics for quantifying harm across different categories\n  - Creation of sector-specific risk treatment playbooks beyond current fintech and healthcare focus\n  - Investigation of human-AI collaboration models for effective risk validation and decision-making\n  - Regional capability building in AI governance, particularly outside London and South East England\n\n## References\n\n[1] Sparkco AI (2025). \"High-Risk AI Systems: A Comprehensive 2025 Definition\".
