This approach addresses dual objectives of pattern accuracy (ensuring discovered knowledge reflects true underlying patterns without excessive distortion from privacy mechanisms) and privacy protection (preventing adversaries from inferring sensitive individual information from published patterns or intermediate computations). Techniques span data perturbation methods adding noise or modifying values before mining (randomization, data swapping, synthetic data generation), cryptographic protocols enabling secure collaborative mining (secure multi-party computation for distributed pattern discovery, homomorphic encryption for encrypted mining operations), anonymization approaches transforming data before release (k-anonymity, l-diversity, t-closeness for publishing datasets supporting subsequent mining), and query restriction mechanisms limiting information disclosure (differential privacy for query responses, output perturbation for pattern publication). Application domains include healthcare analytics discovering disease patterns while protecting patient privacy, financial forensics detecting fraud patterns without exposing transaction details, social network analysis extracting community structures while preserving user privacy, retail behavior analysis identifying purchase patterns without revealing individual shopping histories, and government statistics enabling policy research without compromising citizen confidentiality. The technique applies across mining tasks including association rule mining discovering itemset patterns with support and confidence privacy constraints, classification learning predictive models on privacy-protected training data, clustering grouping similar records while preventing cluster membership disclosure, and outlier detection identifying anomalies without revealing specific outlier identities. Implementation must navigate inherent tensions including privacy-utility tradeoffs where stronger privacy typically reduces pattern accuracy, computational overhead from cryptographic operations or noise addition, and composability challenges when mining results from multiple analyses could enable inference attacks, with evaluation requiring both privacy metrics (information leakage, re-identification risk) and utility metrics (pattern accuracy, false discovery rate).\n    - maturity:: mature\n    - source:: [[Agrawal and Srikant (2000)]], [[GDPR Article 9]], [[ISO/IEC TR 24027]]\n    - authority-score:: 0.95\n\n  - **Semantic Classification**\n    - owl:class:: aigo:PrivacyPreservingDataMining\n    - owl:physicality:: VirtualEntity\n    - owl:role:: Process\n    - owl:inferred-class:: aigo:VirtualProcess\n    - belongsToDomain:: [[AIEthicsDomain]]\n    - implementedInLayer:: [[ConceptualLayer]]\n\n  - #### Relationships\n    id:: 0423-privacy-preserving-data-mining-relationships\n\n  - #### OWL Axioms\n    id:: 0423-privacy-preserving-data-mining-owl-axioms\n    collapsed:: true\n    - ```clojure\n      (Declaration (Class :PrivacyPreservingDataMining))\n(SubClassOf :PrivacyPreservingDataMining :PrivacyPreservingTechnique)\n\n;;
