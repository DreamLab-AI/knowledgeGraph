Implemented universally across Ethereum (with dynamic per-block gas limit around 30 million gas), Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and all EVM chains, gas limit is user-defined for individual transactions (simple ETH transfers use 21,000 gas, complex smart contract interactions may require 100,000-500,000+ gas) and dynamically adjusted by validators for block-level capacity. Unused gas is refunded to users, while insufficient gas limits cause transaction failure without state changes, enabling predictable cost control and protecting against infinite loops in smart contract execution.\n\n\t### Key Characteristics\n\t- **Transaction-Level Control**: Users specify gas limit per transaction\n\t- **Block-Level Capacity**: Network enforces maximum gas per block\n\t- **Refund Mechanism**: Unused gas returned to sender\n\t- **Failure Protection**: Insufficient gas causes transaction reversion\n\t- **Cost Predictability**: Enables users to cap maximum transaction costs\n\n\t### Common Gas Limits\n\t- **Simple ETH Transfer**: 21,000 gas\n\t- **ERC-20 Transfer**: ~65,000 gas\n\t- **Complex Smart Contract**: 100,000-500,000+ gas\n\t- **Block Gas Limit (Ethereum)**: ~30 million gas\n\n\t### Related Concepts\n\t- [[Gas Price]] - Cost per unit of gas\n\t- [[Transaction Fee]] - Total cost (gas limit × gas price)\n\t- [[Base Fee]] - Minimum gas price in EIP-1559\n\t- [[Priority Fee]] - Additional tip for faster inclusion\n\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
