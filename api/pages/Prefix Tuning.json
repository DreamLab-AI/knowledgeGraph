Unlike prompt tuning which only modifies input embeddings, prefix tuning affects attention computation at every layer.\n\n\n\n## Academic Context\n\n- Prefix tuning is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) technique designed to adapt large pre-trained transformer models to specific tasks by training only a small set of continuous vectors, known as prefixes, which are prepended to the key and value inputs of each transformer layer.\n  - Unlike prompt tuning, which modifies only the input embeddings, prefix tuning influences the attention mechanism at every layer, allowing more expressive adaptation while keeping the original model parameters frozen.\n  - This approach was first formalised in the 2021 paper \"Prefix-Tuning: Optimizing Continuous Prompts for Generation\" (Li and Liang, 2021), building on the foundations of prompt-based learning and attention mechanisms in transformers.\n  - The prefixes are learned via gradient-based optimisation, enabling efficient fine-tuning with significantly fewer trainable parameters compared to full model fine-tuning.\n  - Theoretically, prefix tuning can be viewed as a form of continuous prompt tuning that generalises and extends in-context learning (ICL), offering greater flexibility and expressiveness.\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Prefix tuning remains a popular PEFT method due to its computational efficiency and strong performance, especially in low-data or few-shot learning scenarios.\n  - It is widely implemented in industry and research for adapting large language models (LLMs) without incurring the high costs of full fine-tuning.\n  - Notable platforms supporting prefix tuning include Hugging Face’s Transformers library and various open-source PEFT toolkits.\n- Technical capabilities:\n  - Prefix tuning preserves the input sequence length and integrates seamlessly with the transformer’s multi-head attention, allowing task-specific adaptation without altering the model’s architecture.\n  - Recent advances, such as Prefix-Tuning+ and Prefix-RFT, have enhanced prefix tuning by decoupling prefixes from attention or blending supervised and reinforcement fine-tuning, respectively, improving stability and performance on complex tasks.\n- Limitations:\n  - While parameter-efficient, prefix tuning may underperform full fine-tuning on tasks requiring extensive model reconfiguration.\n  - Some modern large models show diminishing returns with vanilla prefix tuning, prompting research into hybrid or enhanced variants.\n- Standards and frameworks:\n  - PEFT methods, including prefix tuning, are increasingly standardised within ML frameworks, promoting reproducibility and interoperability.\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers:\n  - Li, X.
