This register captures diverse risk categories including technical risks (model performance failures, robustness issues, adversarial vulnerabilities), ethical risks (fairness violations, discrimination, bias amplification), legal and compliance risks (regulatory violations, liability exposure, contractual breaches), operational risks (system availability, integration failures, resource constraints), security and privacy risks (data breaches, privacy violations, adversarial attacks), reputational risks (public backlash, stakeholder concerns, brand damage), and societal risks (unintended consequences, systemic impacts, dual-use concerns). Each risk entry typically documents risk identifier and title, detailed description of the risk scenario, affected systems and stakeholders, likelihood rating (rare, unlikely, possible, likely, almost certain), consequence or severity rating (insignificant, minor, moderate, major, catastrophic), overall risk level (likelihood × consequence), assigned risk owner responsible for mitigation, current mitigation measures and controls, residual risk after mitigation, risk status (open, in-progress, mitigated, accepted), review dates and audit trail. The register supports risk governance by enabling risk-based decision-making, prioritization of mitigation efforts, compliance demonstration, trend analysis, and continuous monitoring. Implementation aligns with enterprise risk management frameworks (ISO 31000), AI-specific risk standards (ISO/IEC 23894:2023 AI risk management), and regulatory requirements including EU AI Act Article 9 risk management systems and financial services operational risk frameworks.\n    - maturity:: mature\n    - source:: [[ISO 31000]], [[ISO/IEC 23894:2023]], [[EU AI Act]]\n    - authority-score:: 0.95\n\n  - **Semantic Classification**\n    - owl:class:: aigo:AIRiskRegister\n    - owl:physicality:: VirtualEntity\n    - owl:role:: Process\n    - owl:inferred-class:: aigo:VirtualProcess\n    - belongsToDomain:: [[AIEthicsDomain]]\n    - implementedInLayer:: [[ConceptualLayer]]\n\n  - #### Relationships\n    id:: 0394-ai-risk-register-relationships\n\n  - #### OWL Axioms\n    id:: 0394-ai-risk-register-owl-axioms\n    collapsed:: true\n    - ```clojure\n      (Declaration (Class :AIRiskRegister))\n(SubClassOf :AIRiskRegister :RiskRegister)\n\n(SubClassOf :AIRiskRegister\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :documents :AIRisk))\n(SubClassOf :AIRiskRegister\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :tracks :RiskStatus))\n(SubClassOf :AIRiskRegister\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :assigns :RiskOwner))\n(SubClassOf :AIRiskRegister\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :records :MitigationStrategy))\n(SubClassOf :AIRiskRegister\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :supports :RiskGovernance))\n(SubClassOf :AIRiskRegister\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :enables :RiskMonitoring))\n\n(SubClassOf :AIRiskRegister\n  (ObjectIntersectionOf\n    (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :contains :RiskEntry)\n    (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :facilitates :RiskDecisionMaking)))\n      ```\n\n- ## About 0394 Ai Risk Register\n  id:: 0394-ai-risk-register-about\n\n  - \n  -\n  \n\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
