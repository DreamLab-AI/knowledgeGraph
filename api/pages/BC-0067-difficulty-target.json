The topic of spatial relationships between interlocutors cuts across all of the researchers, but this is not true of immersion. Immersion in a shared virtuality can certainly support the underlying requirements spatial, but the technical infrastructure required is out of scope (so this is struck through on the diagram). Roberts and Steed are the main expertise referenced even though this element is not expanded in the research.\n\n\t- #### Spatial (immersive)\n\t\t- Support for spatiality is important in a group setting so that directional non-verbal cues can find their target.
