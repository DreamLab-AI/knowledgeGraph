It builds upon foundational technologies such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), and extended reality (XR), combining them with advances in sensor technology, computer vision, and artificial intelligence (AI).\n  - The academic foundations lie in human-computer interaction, computer graphics, spatial cognition, and ubiquitous computing, with early research dating back to the 1990s but gaining significant momentum in the 2010s and beyond.\n  - Key developments include the evolution from desktop and mobile computing to spatial computing as the next major computing paradigm, enabling more natural and immersive interactions beyond flat screens.\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Spatial computing is increasingly adopted across industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, logistics, education, and entertainment, where it enhances collaboration, decision-making, and operational efficiency.\n  - Notable platforms and devices include Microsoft HoloLens, Apple Vision Pro, and various AR/VR headsets that enable real-time integration of digital and physical worlds.\n  - The technology leverages edge and cloud computing to manage complex data processing and rendering, ensuring seamless immersive experiences.\n- In the UK, spatial computing is gaining traction in enterprise and academic sectors, with particular growth in North England cities like Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield, which host innovation hubs and research centres focusing on immersive technologies.\n- Technical capabilities include real-time 3D mapping, spatial sound, hand and gesture tracking, and AI-driven contextual understanding of environments.\n- Limitations remain in hardware ergonomics, battery life, processing latency, and standardisation across platforms.\n- Emerging standards and frameworks aim to unify spatial data formats and interoperability, though the field is still evolving.\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic sources include:\n  -
