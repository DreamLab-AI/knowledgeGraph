To describe how this might work, the set designer, DP, director, etc will be able to ideate in a headset based metaverse of the set design, dropping very basic chairs, windows, light sources whatever. There is -no need- then to create a scene in detail. If the interframe consistency (img2img) can deliver then the output on the VP screen can simply inherit the artistic style from the text prompts, and render production quality from the basic building blocks. Everyone in the set (or just DP/director) could then switch in headset to the final output and ideate (verbally) to create the look and feel (lens, bokeh, light, artistic style etc). This isn’t ready yet as the frames need to generate much faster (100x), but it’s very likely coming in months not years. This “next level pre-vis” is being trailed in the Vircadia collaborative environment described in this book, and can be seen illustrated in Figure <a href=\"#fig:vircadiasd\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"fig:vircadiasd\">10.1</a>.\n\t  \n\t  <span class=\"image\">Top panel is a screen grab from Vircadia and the bottom panel is a quick pass through img2img from Stable Diffusion.</span>\n\t- This can be done now through the use of camera robots. A scene can be built in basic outline, the camera tracks can be encoded into the robot, and the scene can be rapidly post rendered by Stability with high inter frame consistency.\n\t- With the help of AI projects such as [LION](https://nv-tlabs.github.io/LION/) it may be possible to pass simple geometry and instructions to ML systems which can create complex textured geometry back into the scene.\n\t- <span class=\"image\">Robot VP</span>\n\n- ##### CheckTemplateVerify\n- [BIP-0119](https://utxos.org/) is “a simple proposal to power the nextwave of Bitcoin adoption and applications. The underlying technology iscarefully engineered to be simple to understand, easy to use, and safeto deploy”. At it’s most basic it is a constructed set of output hashes,creating a Bitcoin address, which if used, can only be spent undercertain defined conditions. This is a feature called ‘covenants’. Itenables a feature called ‘vaults’ which provides [additional safetyfeatures](https://github.com/jamesob/simple-ctv-vault/blob/7dd6c4ca25debb2140cdefb79b302c65d1b24937/README.md)for custodians. There is currently [some debate about the activationprocess](https://blog.bitmex.com/op_ctv-summer-softfork-shenanigans/),and the feeling is that it won’t happen (soon).\n\n- ### Novel VP render pipeline\n\t- Putting the ML image generation on the end of a real-time tracked camera render pipeline might remove the need for detail in set building.
