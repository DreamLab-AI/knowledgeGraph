These solutions address the fragmentation of blockchain ecosystems—where 150+ production blockchains operate in isolation—through bridges, relays, atomic swaps, wrapped tokens, and unified interoperability standards. Major protocols include Polkadot's parachain architecture connecting 100+ specialised chains, Cosmos IBC facilitating 50+ sovereign blockchain communications, Chainlink CCIP providing secure cross-chain messaging for enterprise applications, and Hyperledger Cactus enabling private-public chain integration for supply chain consortia. Whilst interoperability unlocks £180+ billion in cross-chain value transfer annually, the sector faces critical security challenges with £2.6 billion lost to bridge exploits (2021-2023), driving evolution towards trust-minimised protocols, zero-knowledge proofs, and consensus-layer interoperability for the vision of a truly interconnected blockchain internet.\n\t-\n\t- ### Blockchain
