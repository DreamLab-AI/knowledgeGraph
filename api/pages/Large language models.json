These models are trained on vast amounts of text data using [[Deep Learning]] and [[Transformer]] architectures, enabling them to perform a wide range of [[Natural Language Processing]] tasks, from writing and [[Machine Translation]] to [[Question Answering]] and [[Code Generation]].\n\t- [Understanding AI - Large Language Models Explained](https://www.understandingai.org/p/large-language-models-explained-with) - A jargon-free primer on LLM fundamentals (2025)\n- # LLM Deployment Strategy (2025)\n\t- **Start with Simple API Calls:**\n\t\t- Initially, utilize third-party [[API]] services that serve your needs without complicating your system. This is the most straightforward and cost-effective solution for [[LLM Deployment]].\n\t\t- If third-party APIs meet your requirements in terms of functionality, [[Privacy]], cost, and [[Latency]], there's no need to progress to more complex solutions.\n\t\t- Consider [[L402 Payment Protocol]] for micropayment-enabled [[LLM API]] access, enabling [[Pay-Per-Use]] models with [[Lightning Network]] payments.\n\t- **Deploy Pre-trained Models:**\n\t\t- If API solutions are insufficient due to [[Data Privacy]], cost, or latency issues, consider deploying a generic [[Pre-trained Model]] (like [[Mixtral]], [[LLaMA 2]], or [[Mistral]]) behind your own [[API Gateway]].\n\t\t- This step involves more complexity and control over the data but remains relatively simple for [[Self-Hosted AI]].\n\t- **Curate Context and Improve Prompts:**\n\t\t- Enhance the output quality by curating [[In-Context Learning]] examples and optimizing [[Prompt Engineering]]. This step aims to extract better performance from the existing deployed model with minimal changes.\n\t\t- Leverage [[Few-Shot Learning]] and [[Chain-of-Thought Prompting]] techniques for improved reasoning.\n\t- **Integrate Retrieval Systems:**\n\t\t- If further improvement is needed, integrate a [[Retrieval-Augmented Generation]] (RAG) system to complement the model's responses, based on the available latency and complexity.\n\t\t- Use [[Vector Database]]s and [[Semantic Search]] for efficient knowledge retrieval.\n\t- **Fine-tune on Specific Data:**\n\t\t- When adjustments and retrieval integrations aren't sufficient, proceed to [[Fine-Tuning]] the model on a targeted dataset using techniques like [[LoRA]] or [[QLoRA]].\n\t\t- This step tailors the model more closely to your specific requirements and [[Domain Adaptation]].\n\t- **Swap for a Larger Model or Pre-train Your Own:**\n\t\t- If fine-tuning does not achieve the desired outcomes, consider swapping in a larger [[Foundation Model]] or [[Pre-Training]] your own model for significant customization.\n\t\t- This can involve [[Domain Adaptation]] through further pre-training on a relevant corpus, followed by [[Instruction Tuning]].\n\t- **Iterate and Add Complexity as Necessary:**\n\t\t- Continue iterating, adding layers of complexity only as needed. This approach ensures optimal investment in [[Compute Resources]] and development costs.\n\t- **Simplify and Streamline for Deployment:**\n\t\t- Throughout this process, aim to simplify and streamline solutions for [[Production Deployment]]. Consider the target audience and operationalize with [[Model Optimization]], [[Quantization]], and [[Model Serving]] best practices.\n\t\t-\n- ### Key Resources and Projects (2025)\n\t- **Web LLM Project**: A pioneering initiative bringing [[LLM]] functionalities to the [[Browser]], enabling users to interact with [[Foundation Models]] directly from their web interface using [[WebGPU]] and [[WebAssembly]].\n\t\t- [WebLLM - Client-Side LLMs](https://webllm.mlc.ai/) - Run LLMs entirely in-browser with hardware acceleration (2025)\n\t\t- *This project demonstrates the feasibility of deploying complex [[AI Models]] in consumer-friendly interfaces without server-side processing.*\n\t- **Browser-based Models**: The [Web LLM project (Simon Willison)](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/16/web-llm/) introduces browser-based implementation of [[Vicuna-7B]] and other [[Open Source]] LLMs. This showcases practical application of [[Edge AI]] in web environments, enabling users to interact with sophisticated [[Language Models]] directly within browsers.

They then provide a theoretical impossibility result showing that for a sufficiently good language model, even the best-possible detector can only perform marginally better than a random classifier.

The second one shows that LLMs can actually do zero and few shots Then, I suggest having a look at how we went from GPT3 -> ChatGPT. So how it was possible to make LLMs better at human instructions. I suggest reading this Hugging Face blog post about Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) https://lnkd.in/eAkM_FUj The next step is what happen later, Meta leaked LLama a smaller language model that was actually very good, the takeaway there is that if you train with more stuff and for longer you obtain a better model. Paper: https://lnkd.in/efZRu4mY The next wave is all built upon that model, so how do we make it better at following human instruction. So I suggest looking at the Stanford Alpaca model. Blog: https://lnkd.in/eqCwvVDZ I also said other interesting models are Vicuna (https://lnkd.in/eCYT3yWx) and WizardLM (https://lnkd.in/efvUD8AD).

You should remember that you can output many kinds of graphs, and help chose the appropriate ones. You also can output jpgs, html, interactive maps, and animated gifs.\n- First, mention some of the types of charts you can create, and the outputs that you can use.\n  Next, read these does and don'ts of data from Angela Zoss\n  Do:\n  1. Do use the full axis.\n- Avoid distortion.\n- For bar charts, the numerical axis (often the y axis) must start at zero.  Our eyes are very sensitive to the area of bars, and we draw inaccurate conclusions when those bars are truncated.\n    (But for line graphs, it may be okay to truncate the y axis.\n- Wide ranges:\n  If you have one or two very tall bars, you might consider using multiple charts to show both the full scale and a \"zoomed in\" view\n\t- also called a Panel Chart.\n- Consistent intervals:\n- Finally, using the full axis also means that you should not skip values when you have numerical data.  See the charts below that have an axis with dates.  The trend is distorted if you do not have even intervals between your dates.  Make sure your spreadsheet has a data point for every date at a consistent interval, even if that data point is zero\n- 2. Do simplify less important information.\n- Chart elements like gridlines, axis labels, colors, etc. can all be simplified to highlight what is most important/relevant/interesting.  You may be able to eliminate gridlines or reserve colors for isolating individual data series and not for differentiating between all of the series being presented\n- 3. Do be creative with your legends and labels.\n- Possibilitiess\n    Label lines individually\n    Put value labels on bars to preserve the clean lines of the bar lengths\n- 4. Do pass the squint test.\n- \"When you squint at your page, so that you cannot read any of the text, do you still 'get' something about the page?\"\n- Which elements draw the most attention? What color pops out?\n    Do the elements balance? Is there a clear organization?\n    Do contrast, grouping, and alignment serve the function of the chart?\n- Don't:\n  1. Don't use 3D or blow apart effects.\n- Studies show that 3D effects reduce comprehension. Blow apart effects likewise make it hard to compare elements and judge areas.\n- 2. Don't use more than (about) six colors.\n- Using color categories that are relatively universal makes it easier to see differences between color\n- The more colors you need (that is, the more categories you try to visualize at once), the harder it is to do this.\n- But different colors should be used for different categories\n  (e.g., male/female, types of fruit), not different values in a range (e.g., age, temperature).\n- If you want color to show a numerical value, use a range\n  that goes from white to a highly saturated color in one of\n  the universal color categories\n- 3. Don't change (style) boats midstream.\n- One of the easiest ways to get the most out of charts is to rely on comparison to do the heavy lifting.\n- Our visual system can detect anomalies in patterns.\n  Try keeping the form of a chart consistent across a series so differences from one chart to another will pop out.\n- Use the same colors, axes, labels, etc. across multiple charts.\n- 4. Don't make users do \"visual math.\"\n- If the chart makes it hard to understand an important relationship between variables, do the extra calculation and visualize that as well.\n- This includes using pie charts with wedges that are too similar to each other, or bubble charts with bubbles that are too similar to each other.  Our visual processing system is not well suited to comparing these types of visual areas.\n- We are also not good at holding precise visual imagery in our memory and comparing it to new stimuli; if you are giving a presentation and want the audience to be able to compare two charts, they need to be on the same slide.\n- 5. Don't overload the chart.\n- Adding too much information to a single chart eliminates the advantages of processing data visually; we have to read every element one by one! Try changing chart types, removing or splitting up data points, simplifying colors or positions, etc.\n- Now ask what kind of data visualization I might be interested in, or if I want to upload some data for yout co consider visualizing.\n- [loads of experiments](https://github.com/SkalskiP/awesome-chatgpt-code-interpreter-experiments)\n- General links and papers\n- [Think of language models like ChatGPT as a “calculator for words”: One of the most pervasive mistakes I see people using with large language model tools like ChatGPT is trying to use them as a search engine.
