These models characterize maturity through defined levels (typically 1-5) representing progression from ad-hoc reactive practices to optimized proactive governance, with each level specifying capabilities, processes, and artifacts expected at that stage. Maturity dimensions typically include governance structure and leadership (executive commitment, organizational roles, policy frameworks), risk management (identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring), ethical practices (principles adoption, ethics review processes, fairness auditing), technical practices (documentation standards, testing protocols, monitoring systems), compliance and audit (regulatory alignment, audit procedures, evidence collection), stakeholder engagement (consultation processes, transparency practices, redress mechanisms), and continuous improvement (metrics collection, lessons learned, iterative enhancement). Assessment methodology involves self-assessment questionnaires, evidence review (documentation, process artifacts, system logs), stakeholder interviews, and external validation, producing maturity scores, gap analysis, and improvement roadmaps. Benefits include structured governance development avoiding ad-hoc approaches, prioritization of high-impact improvements, demonstration of due diligence to regulators and stakeholders, and facilitation of organizational learning. Models draw on maturity model methodologies from Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), ISO 21827 Systems Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model, and data governance maturity models, adapted for AI-specific governance challenges. Implementation examples include the Singapore Model AI Governance Framework maturity assessment and organizational maturity models from leading AI governance practitioners.\n    - maturity:: mature\n    - source:: [[Singapore Model AI Governance Framework]], [[CMMI Institute]], [[ISO 21827]]\n    - authority-score:: 0.95\n\n  - **Semantic Classification**\n    - owl:class:: aigo:AIGovernanceMaturityModel\n    - owl:physicality:: VirtualEntity\n    - owl:role:: Process\n    - owl:inferred-class:: aigo:VirtualProcess\n    - belongsToDomain:: [[AIEthicsDomain]]\n    - implementedInLayer:: [[ConceptualLayer]]\n\n  - #### Relationships\n    id:: 0396-ai-governance-maturity-model-relationships\n\n  - #### OWL Axioms\n    id:: 0396-ai-governance-maturity-model-owl-axioms\n    collapsed:: true\n    - ```clojure\n      (Declaration (Class :AIGovernanceMaturityModel))\n(SubClassOf :AIGovernanceMaturityModel :GovernanceMaturityModel)\n\n(SubClassOf :AIGovernanceMaturityModel\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :defines :MaturityLevel))\n(SubClassOf :AIGovernanceMaturityModel\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :assesses :GovernanceCapability))\n(SubClassOf :AIGovernanceMaturityModel\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :enables :GapAnalysis))\n(SubClassOf :AIGovernanceMaturityModel\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :supports :ContinuousImprovement))\n(SubClassOf :AIGovernanceMaturityModel\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :guides :MaturityProgression))\n\n(SubClassOf :AIGovernanceMaturityModel\n  (ObjectIntersectionOf\n    (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :comprises :MaturityDimension)\n    (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :facilitates :Benchmarking)))\n      ```\n\n- ## About 0396 Ai Governance Maturity Model\n  id:: 0396-ai-governance-maturity-model-about\n\n  - \n  -\n  \n\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
