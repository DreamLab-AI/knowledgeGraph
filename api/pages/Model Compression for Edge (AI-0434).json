This approach addresses deployment constraints including model size limitations where edge devices typically support models under 5-50MB compared to gigabyte-scale cloud models, memory bandwidth restrictions as edge processors have limited cache and DRAM bandwidth constraining data movement, computational capacity measured in GFLOPS or TOPS rather than TFLOPS of cloud GPUs, energy budgets requiring inference within milliwatt to watt power envelopes for battery-powered or thermally-constrained devices, and latency requirements demanding real-time inference under 20-100ms for interactive applications. Core techniques span quantization reducing numerical precision from FP32 to INT8 (4x compression) or even INT4/binary (8-32x compression) with minimal accuracy loss through quantization-aware training, pruning removing redundant weights through magnitude-based pruning eliminating smallest weights, structured pruning removing entire filters or channels, and iterative pruning gradually increasing sparsity while retraining, knowledge distillation training compact student models to mimic larger teacher models through soft target training and intermediate layer matching, and neural architecture search automatically discovering efficient architectures balancing accuracy and resource consumption through techniques like MobileNet (depthwise separable convolutions), EfficientNet (compound scaling), and hardware-aware NAS. Implementation pipelines typically combine multiple techniques achieving 4-10x compression with under 1% accuracy degradation measured through metrics including compression ratio (original/compressed size), speedup factor (inference time improvement), accuracy delta (performance degradation), and energy per inference (mJ/inference for battery life projections), with frameworks like TensorFlow Model Optimization Toolkit, ONNX Runtime, PyTorch Mobile, and Neural Network Compression Framework (NNCF) providing integrated workflows from training through deployment supporting various compression strategies and target hardware platforms including ARM Cortex-A/M, Qualcomm Hexagon DSP, Apple Neural Engine, and Google Edge TPU.\n    - maturity:: mature\n    - source:: [[TensorFlow Model Optimization]], [[ONNX Runtime]], [[PyTorch Mobile]]\n    - authority-score:: 0.95\n\n  - **Semantic Classification**\n    - owl:class:: aigo:ModelCompressionForEdge\n    - owl:physicality:: VirtualEntity\n    - owl:role:: Process\n    - owl:inferred-class:: aigo:VirtualProcess\n    - belongsToDomain:: [[AIEthicsDomain]]\n    - implementedInLayer:: [[ConceptualLayer]]\n\n  - #### Relationships\n    id:: model-compression-for-edge-(ai-0434)-relationships\n\n  - #### OWL Axioms\n    id:: model-compression-for-edge-(ai-0434)-owl-axioms\n    collapsed:: true\n    - ```clojure\n      (Declaration (Class :ModelCompressionForEdge))\n(AnnotationAssertion rdfs:label :ModelCompressionForEdge \"Model Compression for Edge\"@en)\n(SubClassOf :ModelCompressionForEdge :AIGovernancePrinciple)\n(SubClassOf :ModelCompressionForEdge :EdgeEnablingTechnology)\n\n;; Compression Techniques\n(SubClassOf :ModelCompressionForEdge\n  (ObjectUnionOf :Quantization :Pruning :KnowledgeDistillation :ArchitecturalOptimization))\n\n;; Compression Objectives\n(SubClassOf :ModelCompressionForEdge\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :reduces :ModelSize))\n(SubClassOf :ModelCompressionForEdge\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :reduces :ComputationalComplexity))\n(SubClassOf :ModelCompressionForEdge\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :reduces :MemoryFootprint))\n(SubClassOf :ModelCompressionForEdge\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :reduces :InferenceLatency))\n\n;; Compression Metrics\n(DataPropertyAssertion :achievesCompressionRatio :ModelCompressionForEdge \"4.0\"^^xsd:float)\n(DataPropertyAssertion :maintainsAccuracy :ModelCompressionForEdge \"0.98\"^^xsd:float)\n(DataPropertyAssertion :speedupFactor :ModelCompressionForEdge \"3.5\"^^xsd:float)\n\n;; Target Constraints\n(DataPropertyAssertion :targetModelSizeMB :ModelCompressionForEdge \"5\"^^xsd:integer)\n(DataPropertyAssertion :targetLatencyMS :ModelCompressionForEdge \"20\"^^xsd:integer)\n(DataPropertyAssertion :targetPowerMW :ModelCompressionForEdge \"100\"^^xsd:integer)\n\n;; Standards Reference\n(AnnotationAssertion rdfs:seeAlso :ModelCompressionForEdge\n  \"ONNX Runtime - Model Optimization\")\n(AnnotationAssertion rdfs:seeAlso :ModelCompressionForEdge\n  \"TensorFlow Model Optimization Toolkit\")\n      ```\n\n- ## About Model Compression for Edge (AI-0434)\n  id:: model-compression-for-edge-(ai-0434)-about\n\n  - \n  -\n  \n\n\n\nI appreciate the detailed request, but I must flag a significant issue with your query structure that prevents me from delivering what you've asked for.\n\nYou've requested that I review and improve an ontology entry, yet **no current definition has been provided**. The query states \"CURRENT DEFINITION:\" followed immediately by a filename, but contains no actual content to review, improve, or restructure.\n\nTo provide the comprehensive Logseq-formatted ontology update you've outlined, I would need:\n\n- The existing definition text from AI-0434-model-compression-edge.md\n- Any current assertions, claims, or structured content that requires verification and improvement\n- Specific dated references or time-sensitive material you wish removed\n\n## What I can offer instead\n\nBased on the search results provided, I can construct a **new, comprehensive ontology entry** for Model Compression for Edge AI (2025) in the format you've specified, incorporating:\n\n- Current technical landscape and industry adoption\n- UK and North England context (though the search results contain limited regional specifics)\n- Logseq nested bullet formatting without bold text\n- Academically rigorous citations\n- Appropriate technical precision with cordial tone\n\nHowever, this would be a **creation rather than a revision**. If you'd like me to proceed with this approach, please confirm, and I'll deliver the full ontology entry in your requested format.\n\nAlternatively, if you can paste the current definition text, I'll gladly perform the detailed review and improvement you've outlined.\n\n\n## Metadata\n\n\n- **Migration Status**: Ontology block enriched on 2025-11-12\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-12\n- **Review Status**: Comprehensive editorial review\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable\n\n\n\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
