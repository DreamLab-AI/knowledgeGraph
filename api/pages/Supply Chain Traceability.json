The updated entry reframes it as a distinct domain with blockchain as one enabling technology amongst several (RFID, IoT sensors, smart contracts). This reflects 2025 reality: traceability is the problem; blockchain is a solution. The entry now emphasises practical applications, technical precision, and UK/North England context whilst maintaining cordial rigour and the occasional wry observation about supply chain complexity.\n\n\n## Metadata\n\n\n- **Migration Status**: Ontology block enriched on 2025-11-12\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-12\n- **Review Status**: Comprehensive editorial review\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
