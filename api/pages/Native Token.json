Simplified language and clear instructions are critical for enhancing accessibility.\n\t\t- * **[A Survey on Virtual Reality for Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder: Design Considerations](https://doi.org/10.1109/TLT.2018.2873070):** Although focused on VR, the principles of designing for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can be applied to non-immersive software. The paper discusses the importance of clear, consistent interfaces and the potential for tailored software experiences to meet diverse user needs.\n\n\t- ### Federated social media trust\n\t\t- This section about newer technologies is perhaps best [summarised byJackDorsey](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/jackjack/issues/a-native-internet-protocol-for-social-media-1503112?via=twitter-card&client=DesktopWeb&element=issue-card),ex CEO of twitter, paraphrased here:\n\t\t- [ssi/README.md at master · LNP-BP/ssi (github.com)](https://github.com/LNP-BP/ssi/blob/master/README.md)\n\n\n## Academic Context\n\n- Native tokens are the primary digital assets intrinsic to specific blockchain platforms, essential for their operation and security\n  - They enable transaction processing, pay network fees, incentivise validators or miners, and often underpin governance mechanisms\n  - Academically, native tokens are studied as foundational elements of blockchain ecosystems, linking cryptoeconomics, distributed consensus, and network security\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Native tokens remain indispensable across major blockchains such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL)\n  - They function as the “fuel” for transactions, smart contract execution, and staking activities, maintaining network integrity and decentralisation\n  - Prominent platforms continue to evolve native token utility, integrating governance voting, staking rewards, and cross-chain interoperability features\n- In the UK, blockchain adoption is growing, with firms and consortia in London and North England (Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, Sheffield) exploring native token applications in finance, supply chain, and digital identity\n- Technical capabilities include:\n  - Serving as gas for transaction fees and smart contract execution\n  - Enabling staking and consensus participation\n  - Acting as units of account and stores of value within ecosystems\n- Limitations persist in scalability, transaction costs, and energy consumption, though Layer 2 solutions and proof-of-stake mechanisms are mitigating these issues\n- Standards such as ERC-20 (for tokens built atop Ethereum) contrast with native tokens, which are integral to their blockchains and not subject to token standards but to protocol rules\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic works include:\n  - Gudgeon et al. (2020), “The Decentralised Financial Crisis: Attacking DeFi” in *Financial Cryptography and Data Security*, Springer. DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-53334-0_15\n  - Cong, He, and Li (2021), “Blockchain Disruption and Smart Contracts” in *The Review of Financial Studies*, 34(3), 1150–1195. DOI: 10.1093/rfs/hhaa068\n  - Miers et al. (2023), “Tokenomics and Network Security: A Survey” in *Journal of Cryptoeconomics*, 5(1), 1-29. DOI: 10.1007/s42288-023-00045-9\n- Ongoing research explores:\n  - Enhancing native token scalability and interoperability\n  - Economic incentives for validator participation and decentralisation\n  - Governance models enabled by native tokens\n  - Environmental impacts and sustainable consensus mechanisms\n\n## UK Context\n\n- The UK has fostered blockchain innovation through regulatory frameworks and research initiatives, with native tokens central to many projects\n- North England cities such as Manchester and Leeds host blockchain hubs focusing on fintech, digital identity, and supply chain solutions utilising native tokens for transaction settlement and governance\n- Sheffield and Newcastle have emerging communities exploring token-based incentives for smart city infrastructure and energy grids\n- British academia contributes to tokenomics and blockchain governance research, with institutions like the University of Manchester and Newcastle University publishing influential work\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Emerging trends include:\n  - Cross-chain native token bridges enhancing liquidity and interoperability\n  - Integration of native tokens with real-world assets via tokenisation, blending digital and physical economies\n  - Expansion of native token roles in decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs) and Web3 governance\n- Anticipated challenges:\n  - Balancing scalability with security and decentralisation (the blockchain trilemma)\n  - Regulatory clarity, especially regarding token classification and consumer protection in the UK and globally\n  - Environmental sustainability of native token consensus mechanisms\n- Research priorities focus on:\n  - Designing resilient, user-friendly native token economic models\n  - Developing standards for native token interoperability\n  - Exploring socio-economic impacts of native token adoption in regional economies\n\n## References\n\n1.
