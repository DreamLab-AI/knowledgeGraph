The encoder employs recurrent neural networks (RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), or transformer self-attention layers to progressively extract salient features and semantic meaning from input sequences, producing a context representation capturing essential information while discarding redundant details. The decoder utilizes similar architectural components (RNNs, transformers) operating autoregressively to generate output sequences token-by-token, conditioning each prediction on previously generated tokens and the encoder's context representation through attention mechanisms that enable dynamic focus on relevant input portions during generation. Modern transformer-based encoder-decoder architectures (T5, BART, mBART, mT5) incorporate multi-head self-attention layers (allowing parallel processing of sequence elements and modeling long-range dependencies), cross-attention mechanisms (enabling decoder to attend selectively to encoder representations), position encodings (absolute or relative position information compensating for attention's permutation invariance), feed-forward networks (capturing complex non-linear transformations), and layer normalization (training stability). The encoder employs bidirectional self-attention (attending to all input positions simultaneously for comprehensive context understanding), while the decoder uses causally masked self-attention (preventing attention to future tokens during autoregressive generation to maintain conditional independence). Training employs teacher forcing (providing ground truth previous tokens to decoder during training for stable gradient flow) with maximum likelihood objectives (cross-entropy loss minimizing negative log-likelihood of target sequences), while inference uses beam search or sampling strategies to generate high-quality outputs. The architecture addresses the fundamental challenge of mapping between sequences of different lengths and modalities, with applications spanning Google Translate, GPT-based chat systems, speech-to-text services, and multi-modal AI systems, as established in foundational work by Sutskever et al.

The revised entry reflects 2025 understanding of encoder-decoder systems, emphasising attention mechanisms and modern Transformer implementations rather than earlier RNN-centric approaches. UK context has been integrated where relevant, though the encoder-decoder architecture remains fundamentally international in its development and deployment. The somewhat amusing reality is that despite decades of neural network research, the basic encoder-decoder principle—compress then expand—remains elegantly simple, even as implementations have grown considerably more sophisticated.\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-11\n- **Review Status**: Comprehensive editorial review\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
