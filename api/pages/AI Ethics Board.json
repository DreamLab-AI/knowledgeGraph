This governance body evaluates proposed AI systems against ethical frameworks, assesses potential harms and benefits, reviews fairness and bias implications, examines privacy and data protection compliance, and ensures alignment with responsible AI principles. The board operates through structured ethical review processes including proposal submission and screening, expert deliberation and assessment, stakeholder consultation and impact evaluation, ethical decision-making with documented rationale, and ongoing monitoring of deployed systems. Authority and scope typically include power to approve, conditionally approve with modifications, defer for additional information, or reject AI projects, mandate ethical impact assessments and fairness audits, require mitigation measures for identified risks, and escalate significant ethical concerns to executive leadership. Effective boards maintain independence from AI development teams to avoid conflicts of interest, possess diverse expertise spanning technical, ethical, legal, and social dimensions, engage affected communities in deliberations, and report to senior governance structures. Implementation follows models from research ethics committees and institutional review boards, adapted for AI-specific challenges as recommended by the EU High-Level Expert Group on AI and IEEE P7000 series standards.\n    - maturity:: mature\n    - source:: [[EU HLEG AI]], [[IEEE P7000]], [[ISO/IEC 42001:2023]]\n    - authority-score:: 0.95\n\n  - **Semantic Classification**\n    - owl:class:: aigo:AIEthicsBoard\n    - owl:physicality:: VirtualEntity\n    - owl:role:: Process\n    - owl:inferred-class:: aigo:VirtualProcess\n    - belongsToDomain:: [[AIEthicsDomain]]\n    - implementedInLayer:: [[ConceptualLayer]]\n\n  - #### Relationships\n    id:: 0388-ai-ethics-board-relationships\n\n  - #### OWL Axioms\n    id:: 0388-ai-ethics-board-owl-axioms\n    collapsed:: true\n    - ```clojure\n      (Declaration (Class :AIEthicsBoard))\n(SubClassOf :AIEthicsBoard :EthicsCommittee)\n\n(SubClassOf :AIEthicsBoard\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :conducts :EthicalReview))\n(SubClassOf :AIEthicsBoard\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :comprises :MultidisciplinaryExperts))\n(SubClassOf :AIEthicsBoard\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :evaluates :AISystem))\n(SubClassOf :AIEthicsBoard\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :provides :EthicalGuidance))\n(SubClassOf :AIEthicsBoard\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :hasAuthority :VetoPower))\n(SubClassOf :AIEthicsBoard\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :reports_to :AIGovernanceFramework))\n\n(DisjointWith :AIEthicsBoard :DataEthicsCommittee)\n(DisjointWith :AIEthicsBoard :ClinicalEthicsCommittee)\n      ```\n\n- ## About 0388 Ai Ethics Board\n  id:: 0388-ai-ethics-board-about\n\n  - \n  -\n  \n\n\t- ## HR & Onboarding\n\n\t- ## HR & Onboarding\n\n\t- ## HR & Onboarding\n\n\t- ## HR & Onboarding\n\n- ## Onboarding and triaging\n\t- {{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDevgsp9vn0}}\n\n- ## **Conclusion**\n  \n  12\\. 5 Agentic AI Examples: Inspiring Use Cases Shaping the Future \\- ThoughtSpot, accessed on January 14, 2025, [https://www.thoughtspot.com/data-trends/ai/agentic-ai-examples](https://www.thoughtspot.com/data-trends/ai/agentic-ai-examples)  \n  13\\.

The query references \"FILENAME: AI-0388-ai-ethics-board.md\" but this content doesn't appear in your message.\n\nTo provide the comprehensive, technically rigorous update you've requested—particularly with UK contextualisation and Logseq formatting—I would need to see the existing entry first. Without it, I cannot meaningfully assess what requires updating, what assertions need verification, or where improvements should be targeted.\n\n## What I can offer instead\n\nBased on the search results provided, I can construct a fresh, current ontology entry for AI Ethics Boards formatted to your specifications. However, this would be a new composition rather than a revision of existing content.\n\nAlternatively, if you can supply the current definition file, I can:\n\n- Systematically review each assertion against 2025 sources\n- Remove dated material (the search results reference 2024 initiatives and earlier frameworks)\n- Integrate UK and North England context where applicable\n- Convert to Logseq nested bullet format with headings\n- Provide complete academic citations with DOIs\n- Maintain technical precision with appropriate cordial tone\n\n**Which approach would be most useful?** Should I construct a fresh entry from the search results, or would you prefer to share the existing definition for revision?\n\n\n## Metadata\n\n\n- **Migration Status**: Ontology block enriched on 2025-11-12\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-12\n- **Review Status**: Comprehensive editorial review\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable\n\n\n\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
