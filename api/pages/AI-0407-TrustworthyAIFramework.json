Developed primarily by the EU High-Level Expert Group on AI (2019) and formalized in the EU AI Act (2024), this framework defines trustworthiness through seven key dimensions: human agency and oversight (preserving meaningful human control), technical robustness and safety (ensuring reliable and secure performance), privacy and data governance (protecting personal information and data rights), transparency and explainability (enabling understanding of system operation and decisions), diversity non-discrimination and fairness (ensuring equitable treatment across demographic groups), societal and environmental wellbeing (considering broader impacts on communities and sustainability), and accountability (establishing clear responsibility and redress mechanisms). The framework implements a risk-based approach categorizing AI systems by impact level (unacceptable risk, high risk, limited risk, minimal risk) with corresponding governance requirements, mandates conformity assessment and certification for high-risk applications, requires documented compliance evidence including technical documentation and impact assessments, and aligns with international standards including ISO/IEC 42001 AI management systems and IEEE ethically aligned design principles. Implementation establishes organizational structures spanning board-level oversight committees, management-level governance officers, and operational-level development teams, while addressing practical challenges including resource constraints for SMEs, framework fragmentation across jurisdictions, dynamic technology evolution, and measurement difficulties for abstract trustworthiness criteria.\n    -
