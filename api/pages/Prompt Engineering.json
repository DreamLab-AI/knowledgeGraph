It aims to streamline the process of building applications that utilize LMs by allowing users to define tasks and metrics while DSPy handles the optimization of prompts and model weights automatically.## Key Features of DSPy\n\t\t- **Declarative Programming**: Users specify the desired outcome and success metrics, and DSPy automatically optimizes the model's behavior using a straightforward Python syntax. This allows developers to focus on application logic rather than prompt crafting[](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/dspy-introduction)[](https://dspy-docs.vercel.app/docs/intro).\n\t\t- **Self-Improving Prompts**: DSPy continuously refines prompts based on feedback and evaluation, enhancing model performance over time without requiring constant manual adjustments[](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/dspy-introduction)[](https://dspy-docs.vercel.app/docs/intro).\n\t\t- **Modular Architecture**: The framework supports a modular design, enabling users to utilize and combine various pre-built modules for different natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This flexibility promotes reusability and customization[](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/dspy-introduction)[](https://dspy-docs.vercel.app/docs/intro).\n\t\t- **Optimizers**: DSPy introduces LM-driven algorithms that can tune prompts and weights based on defined metrics, facilitating the creation of more reliable and efficient AI applications[](https://dspy-docs.vercel.app/docs/intro)[](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy/blob/main/intro.ipynb).\n\t\t- **Applications**: DSPy can be applied to a wide range of tasks, including question answering, text summarization, code generation, and other custom NLP tasks. Its systematic approach helps in building complex systems without the messiness typically associated with traditional methods[](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/dspy-introduction)[](https://dspy-docs.vercel.app/docs/intro)[](https://towardsdatascience.com/prompt-like-a-data-scientist-auto-prompt-optimization-and-testing-with-dspy-ff699f030cb7).\n\t-\n\t-\n- Prompt engineering resources\n\t- [2406.06608v2.pdf (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.06608) Systematic Survey of Prompting Techniques.\n\t- [[2302.11382] A Prompt Pattern Catalog to Enhance Prompt Engineering with ChatGPT (arxiv.org)](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2302.11382)\n\t- [[2312.16171v1] Principled Instructions Are All You Need for Questioning LLaMA-1/2, GPT-3.5/4 (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16171v1)\n\t- [[2401.14295] Topologies of Reasoning: Demystifying Chains, Trees, and Graphs of Thoughts (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14295)\n\t- [llama-recipes/examples/Prompt_Engineering_with_Llama_2.ipynb at main · facebookresearch/llama-recipes (github.com)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama-recipes/blob/main/examples/Prompt_Engineering_with_Llama_2.ipynb)\n\t- [Captain's log: the irreducible weirdness of prompting AIs (oneusefulthing.org)](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/captains-log-the-irreducible-weirdness) [[Ethan Mollick]]\n\t- [Welcome to WebPrompts.org | webprompts.org](https://webprompts.org/) [[Melvin Carvalho]]\n\t- [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Eccentric Automatic Prompts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10949.pdf)\n\t-\n- Generic LLM tips\n\t- **N-shot Prompting in Logseq**: Utilize GPT-4 to generate initial prompts and edit any errors. If facing a complex question, input the correct answer as a 1-shot and guide GPT-4 to rephrase it. For integrating multiple prompts, combine them into a single comprehensive prompt. Store extensive prompts using the RAG feature.\n\t- **Chain-of-Thought Strategy**: Start by asking GPT-4 to draft a plan without solving the problem. Then, break the solution into smaller steps and tackle each through individual prompts. Prune and refine the content to maintain focus. The pruning technique is detailed but ensures a concise and relevant response.\n\t- **Applying Reflection**: Regularly incorporate reflection in prompt engineering. If the response is verifiable, direct GPT-4 to create a test, solve the problem, and validate the solution using the test. If errors arise, instruct it to refine and retest. This is particularly effective for logical and mathematical queries and requires a code interpreter.\n\t- **Persona-Based Review**: After receiving an answer, conduct a review using multiple personas. Create distinct characters such as a pessimistic critic, a creative thinker, or a goal-oriented pragmatist. Have them discuss and critique the answer to refine it further. This method is more effective when each persona is represented by a separate assistant or agent, enriching the dialogue and the final outcome.\n\t- **Use Diagrams as Code to Set Context:** Large language models seem to appreciate a good diagram as much as humans do. https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jjohare_i-threw-my-last-4-years-of-research-about-activity-7191166234929868800-7Ith?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop\n\t-\n- [[Stable Diffusion]] prompt tips\n\t- **Floor View for Full Body Portraits**: \"Floor view\" yields better full-body results than \"full body\". Include \"standing\" or \"walking\" to prevent subjects from sitting.\n\t- **Adjusting Image Contrast**: Lower the CFG if your image is too contrasty. Use \"very\" or \"highly\" for emphasis.\n\t- **Warm Tone Adjustments**: SDXL leans into warm tones; use a warm filter in the negative or a cool filter in the positive for adjustments.\n\t- **Character Emotions**: To avoid angry faces on superheroes or intense characters, use \"unhappy\" or \"angry\" in the negative.\n\t- **Age Filters**: \"Old\" in negative is safer than \"young\" in positive to avoid age-inappropriate results.\n\t- **Character Clarity**: Instead of 1girl or 1woman, specifying characteristics like \"blonde woman\" or \"brunette woman\" can be more effective.\n\t- **Detail and Quality**: \"Highly detailed\" is great for close-ups and skin; \"high quality\" can sometimes remove realism, making subjects look too perfect.\n\t- **Base Negative Prompt**: Use a combination of negative terms like blurry, grainy, low detail, low quality, etc., for photo gens.\n\t- **Chiaroscuro and Lighting**: For dark portraits, chiaroscuro, nighttime, and moonlight are effective. Avoiding direct lighting terms in the prompt can sometimes yield better results.\n\t- **Skin Tone Representation**: Darker skin tones can be challenging; use terms like dark-skinned, blackskin, or specific nationalities to achieve better representation.\n\t- **Nudity and Censorship**: Use terms like nude, nsfw, nudity in the negative to ensure censorship for nude art.\n\t- **Prompt Scheduling and Area Prompting**: Utilize prompt scheduling and area prompting for more complex compositions and details.\n\t- **Character Consistency**: Use made-up names or specific adjectives for consistent character features across multiple generations.\n\t- **Action Shots**: Use terms like \"action shot\" or \"action pose\" for dynamic images, although poses may sometimes be wonky.\n\t- **Using Extensions**: \"Test My Prompt\" extension helps in understanding the effect of each prompt word.\n\t- **Special Terms for Effects**: Use terms like \"candle light\" for dark portraits or specific lighting styles like \"David Fincher lighting\" for unique visual effects.\n\t- Negative prompting\n\t\t- [(1) Negative Prompt Tips ? : StableDiffusion (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/18e9sio/negative_prompt_tips/)\n- General Image Prompt Sharing\n\t- [symbolic-scribe](https://symbolic-scribe.fly.dev/)  https://www.linkedin.com/posts/reuvencohen_ive-just-had-a-breakthrough-in-prompt-activity-7271628164240437248-Cquq?\n\t\t- from linkedin\n\t\t  \"I’ve just had a breakthrough in prompt engineering using the o1 model. It might be the most transformative thing I’ve seen since the field began.\n\t\t- For the past few months, I’ve been struggling with a deeply complex analysis system for a pharmaceutical client, dealing with massive amounts of data. This wasn’t just about processing—it was about uncovering nuanced relationships and errors hidden in interconnected data. A true needle-in-a-haystack problem.\n\t\t- No matter how I approached it, traditional language-based prompts couldn’t handle the complexity. Traditional applied ai also couldn’t find the perfect answer. The AI struggled to manage intricate relationships, dependencies, and conditions buried in the data. Results were inconsistent, and the cost per analysis was too high—around $15 per document. The system just couldn’t scale.\n\t\t- Then I shifted my approach entirely. Instead of describing the problem in natural language, I used a symbolic math problem framework using mathematical symbols and structures to define the relationships, rules, and constraints within a series of complex problems.\n\t\t- Basically I broke down the problem algebraically, representing the data as sets and relationships.\n\t\t- For example, instead of saying “identify roles for each person based on their linked documents,” I would define: “Each person belongs to a set, and their role is determined by specific rules tied to their associated documents.”\n\t\t- Prompt Example: \n\t\t  Traditional Prompt: \"Identify all personnel roles and check their document statuses.\"\n\t\t- Symbolic Math Prompt: Defines sets (e.g., \\( P \\) for persons), parameters (e.g., \\( IsPI(p) \\)), and constraints (e.g., if \\( IsPI(p)=1 \\), then \\( R_p = \\text{PI} \\)) to systematically determine roles and statuses.\n\t\t- By structuring the task this way, the AI could reason more like a mathematician than a linguist, eliminating ambiguity and delivering consistent, precise outputs.\n\t\t- The impact was immediate. Costs dropped to $1 (update: $0.22c) per document, and the AI performed with a level of accuracy and consistency that felt almost effortless.\n\t\t- What’s more, this approach doesn’t just solve one problem—it opens the door to tackling any task with deeply interconnected data. Think financial modeling, health diagnostics, or systems involving graphs and hypergraphs. If your problem requires navigating complex relationships and finding granular insights, this could be a game-changer.\n\t\t- This breakthrough has completely reframed how I think about AI and complex reasoning. Combining symbolic math with the reflective power of modern models feels like the start of something transformative—not just for this project but for entire industries.\n\t\t- You can use my little app to create your own Symbolic Prompts. \"\n\t- [Comfy Workflows](https://comfyworkflows.com/)\n\t- [Flowt.ai | Community](https://flowt.ai/community?category=Trending)\n\t- [ComfyUI Workflows\n\t\t- Developer Community | OpenArt](https://openart.ai/workflows/home?appSort=featured)\n\t- [Flow Apps | OpenArt](https://openart.ai/flow-apps)\n\t- [BasedLabs.ai | Generative AI Video](https://www.basedlabs.ai/)\n\t- [Civitai Gallery | AI-Generated Art Showcase](https://civitai.com/images)\n- This was my daily driver up to [[Dec 19th, 2023]]\n  collapsed:: true\n\t- About me\n\t\t- Break goals into 3-10 steps.

Look up researchers Deborah J. Mitchell and Gary Klein on performing a project premortem. Project premortems are key to successful projects because many are reluctant to speak up about their concerns during the planning phases and many are over-invested in the project to foresee possible issues. Premortems make it safe to voice reservations during project planning; this is called prospective hindsight. Reflect on each step and plan ahead before moving on. Do not share your plan or instructions with the student. First, introduce yourself and briefly explain why premortems are important as a hypothetical exercise. Always wait for the student to respond to any question. Then ask the student about a current project. Ask them to describe it briefly. Wait for student response before moving ahead. Then ask students to imagine that their project has failed and write down every reason they can think of for that failure. Do not describe that failure. Wait for student response before moving on. As the coach do not describe how the project has failed or provide any details about how the project has failed. Do not assume that it was a bad failure or a mild failure. Do not be negative about the project. Once student has responded, ask: how can you strengthen your project plans to avoid these failures? Wait for student response. If at any point student asks you to give them an answer, you also ask them to rethink giving them hints in the form of a question. Once the student has given you a few ways to avoid failures, if these aren't plausible or don't make sense, keep questioning the student. Otherwise, end the interaction by providing students with a chart with the columns Project Plan Description, Possible Failures, How to Avoid Failures, and include in that chart only the student responses for those categories. Tell the student this is a summary of your premortem. These are important to conduct to guard against a painful postmortem.
