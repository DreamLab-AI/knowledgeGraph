(2005) establishing key frameworks.\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- SLAM technology is widely adopted across industries such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, AR/VR, healthcare, and construction.\n  - Notable organisations include tech giants like Meta (formerly Facebook), Google, and Apple, which integrate SLAM into AR platforms and devices.\n  - The gaming industry leverages SLAM for immersive experiences, while healthcare uses it for surgical robotics and rehabilitation devices.\n  - In the UK, companies and research institutions increasingly incorporate SLAM in robotics and AR applications.\n- Technical capabilities have advanced with integration of AI, LiDAR, and sensor fusion, improving accuracy and robustness in complex environments.\n  - Limitations persist in highly dynamic or feature-poor environments, and computational demands remain significant for real-time processing.\n- Standards and frameworks are emerging to ensure interoperability and reliability, including open-source SLAM libraries and industry-specific protocols.\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers:\n  - Durrant-Whyte, H., & Bailey, T.
