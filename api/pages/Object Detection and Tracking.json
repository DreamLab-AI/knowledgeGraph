This capability is essential for autonomous systems to understand dynamic environments, predict object motion, and make safe navigation decisions. Modern systems employ deep learning detectors (YOLO, Faster R-CNN) combined with tracking algorithms (Kalman filters, SORT, DeepSORT).\n\n\n\n## Academic Context\n\n- Brief contextual overview\n  - Object Detection and Tracking is a core computer vision task that integrates spatial localisation with temporal association to identify, classify, and follow objects across video sequences or sensor streams\n  - The field has evolved from classical feature-based methods to deep learning-driven architectures, enabling robust performance in dynamic environments\n\n- Key developments and current state\n  - Modern approaches combine deep learning detectors (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN, CenterNet) with advanced tracking algorithms (e.g., SORT, DeepSORT, FairMOT)\n  - The emergence of end-to-end detection-by-tracking frameworks (e.g., MI-DETR, QueryMeldNet) has improved accuracy, especially for small and occluded objects\n  - Transformer-based models and dynamic query mechanisms are now central to state-of-the-art performance\n\n- Academic foundations\n  - Theoretical underpinnings include probabilistic filtering (Kalman filters), data association (Hungarian algorithm), and deep feature learning\n  - Research continues to address challenges in occlusion, scale variation, and real-time inference\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Widely deployed in autonomous vehicles, surveillance, robotics, and industrial automation\n  - Leading platforms include Datature, Encord, and Roboflow, supporting both open-source and proprietary tracking pipelines\n  - UK organisations such as Oxbotica (Oxford), FiveAI (London), and Wayve (Cambridge) are integrating advanced detection and tracking for autonomous mobility\n\n- Notable organisations and platforms\n  - Roboflow: Open-source tracking tools and datasets\n  - Encord: Annotation and tracking software for enterprise applications\n  - Datature: End-to-end computer vision workflows\n\n- UK and North England examples where relevant\n  - Manchester’s AI City initiative leverages object detection for smart city surveillance and traffic management\n  - Leeds-based companies are applying tracking in retail analytics and crowd monitoring\n  - Newcastle and Sheffield universities collaborate with local industry on robotics and autonomous systems, using detection and tracking for navigation and safety\n\n- Technical capabilities and limitations\n  - State-of-the-art models achieve high accuracy and real-time performance, but challenges remain with occlusion, rapid motion, and scale variation\n  - Modular architectures (tracking-by-detection) allow flexibility, while integrated approaches (detection-by-tracking) offer superior performance at the cost of complexity\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Common benchmarks include MOTChallenge, BDD100K, and COCO\n  - Open-source frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Detectron2 are widely used for research and deployment\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers and sources\n  - Carion, N., Massa, F., Synnaeve, G., Usunier, N., Kirillov, A., & Zagoruyko, S.
