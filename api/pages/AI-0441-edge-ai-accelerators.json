These include Neural Processing Units (NPUs), Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) optimized for neural network computations. NPUs integrate directly into mobile processors (Qualcomm Hexagon, Apple Neural Engine) achieving 2-21 TOPS (tera-operations per second) with 2-10 TOPS per watt efficiency. TPUs and ASICs deliver peak performance 5-100x higher than CPUs while consuming 10-50x less power per inference. FPGAs offer programmable flexibility allowing deployment-specific optimizations when fixed-function accelerators are unavailable. Edge AI accelerators exploit parallelism in matrix multiplication operations inherent to neural networks, typically supporting low-precision arithmetic (INT8, FP16) for dramatic speedups versus full-precision FP32 computation. Hardware features including dedicated memory hierarchies, reduced precision datapaths, and specialized reduction circuits eliminate unnecessary energy overhead from general-purpose processors. Platforms like NVIDIA Jetson embed GPUs for accelerated inference on mobile robots and autonomous vehicles. Meta's Orion custom silicon combines custom accelerators for AR processing at mobile-friendly power budgets. Edge accelerators enable real-time video processing, low-latency autonomous responses, and offline operation while respecting power and thermal constraints. The trend toward tightly integrated AI accelerators reflects the fundamental mismatch between neural network parallelism and general-purpose processor design, necessitating specialized hardware for practical edge intelligence.\n    - maturity:: mature\n    - source:: \n    - authority-score:: 0.95\n\n  - **Semantic Classification**\n    - owl:class:: aigo:EdgeAIAccelerators\n    - owl:physicality:: VirtualEntity\n    - owl:role:: Process\n    - owl:inferred-class:: aigo:VirtualProcess\n    - belongsToDomain:: [[AIEthicsDomain]]\n    - implementedInLayer:: [[ConceptualLayer]]\n\n  - #### Relationships\n    id:: edge-ai-accelerators-(ai-0441)-relationships\n\n  - #### OWL Axioms\n    id:: edge-ai-accelerators-(ai-0441)-owl-axioms\n    collapsed:: true\n    - ```clojure\n      (Declaration (Class :EdgeAIAccelerators))\n(AnnotationAssertion rdfs:label :EdgeAIAccelerators \"Edge AI Accelerators\"@en)\n(SubClassOf :EdgeAIAccelerators :AIGovernancePrinciple)\n\n;; Accelerator Types\n(DisjointClasses :NPU :TPU :DSP :FPGA :ASIC)\n\n;; Performance Characteristics\n(DataPropertyAssertion :hasPeakTOPS :EdgeAIAccelerators \"21\"^^xsd:integer)\n(DataPropertyAssertion :hasPowerWatts :EdgeAIAccelerators \"10\"^^xsd:integer)\n(DataPropertyAssertion :hasEfficiencyTOPSPerWatt :EdgeAIAccelerators \"2.1\"^^xsd:float)\n\n;; Supported Precision\n(SubClassOf :EdgeAIAccelerators\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :supports :INT8Precision))\n(SubClassOf :EdgeAIAccelerators\n  (ObjectSomeValuesFrom :supports :FP16Precision))\n      ```",
