Obsidian's key feature is its ability to create a network of interlinked notes, enabling users to visualize the connections between their thoughts and information.\n\t- ### Notion\n\t\t- **Notion**: is a versatile paid tool that combines note-taking, task management, databases, and knowledge graphing. Notion allows users to create linked notes and true databases, making is very performant. It has a lot of GPT integration but this costs extra.\n\t\t- {{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFNYUl1pv54}}\n\t\t- {{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnZR7RPH8sA}}\n\t- ### Logseq\n\t\t- **Logseq**: is very similar to Obsidian, but self hosted and open source. It works on top of plain text files stored in a local system. It supports markdown and Org-mode formatting and allows for hierarchical and networked note-taking. It can be connected to it's mobile app via github.\n\t\t- Integration to [[Large language models]] can be OpenAI or local.\n\t\t\t- Compare notion, obsidian, and logseq, using a simply markdown table with coloured dots\n\t\t- [ChatGPT Logseq Summarizer (openai.com)](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-3ooWV51Sb-logseq-summarizer)\n\t\t-\n\t\t- ![Screenshot 2024-01-06 120253.png](../assets/Screenshot_2024-01-06_120253_1706020225813_0.png)\n\t\t- ![Screenshot 2024-01-18 103043.png](../assets/Screenshot_2024-01-18_103043_1706020238116_0.png)\n\t\t- ![Screenshot 2024-01-18 102807.png](../assets/Screenshot_2024-01-18_102807_1706020247381_0.png)\n\t- ### Other Tools\n\t\t- **Roam Research**: This tool is known for its bi-directional linking and its graph overview, which shows how notes are interconnected. Roam is designed to facilitate associative thought, making it easy to see connections between ideas.\n\t\t- **Dynalist**: A list-making application that allows for infinite levels of nesting. While primarily a list-maker, it also offers features for linking between lists and items, thereby enabling some degree of knowledge graphing.\n\t\t- **TiddlyWiki**: A unique non-linear notebook for capturing, organizing, and sharing complex information. It allows for linking between different Tiddlers (small pieces of information) to create a web of notes.\n\t\t- **Zettelkasten Method Tools**: This method emphasizes creating a network of linked notes. Tools like Zettlr or The Archive are designed with the Zettelkasten philosophy in mind, offering features that facilitate linking between notes and creating a knowledge web.\n\t\t- **Microsoft OneNote**: A digital notebook that provides a flexible canvas for capturing notes in various formats. It allows for some degree of linking and organizing, suitable for knowledge management.\n\t\t- **Evernote**: Known for note-taking, it also provides features for organizing and linking notes, although it's more linear compared to tools like Obsidian or Logseq.\n- # Misc\n\t- [Taking RAG apps from POC to Production, Fast - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQsN0_eVaEs)\n\t- [AI-Powered Search: Embedding-Based Retrieval and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) | by Daniel Tunkelang | Apr, 2024 | Medium](https://dtunkelang.medium.com/ai-powered-search-embedding-based-retrieval-and-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-cabeaba26a8b)\n\t- [AutoRAG documentation (marker-inc-korea.github.io)](https://marker-inc-korea.github.io/AutoRAG/index.html)\n\t- [llmware-ai/llmware: Providing enterprise-grade LLM-based development framework, tools, and fine-tuned models.
