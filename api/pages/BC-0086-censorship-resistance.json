It facilitates decentralised, non-custodial coordination, allowing contributors to collaborate on creating and managing digital objects – including software, merchandise, or content – without centralised control.\n\t\t\t- The project's governance is maintained through a system of \"merits,\" which quantify and reward contributions based on predefined rules. Operating without servers or traditional centralisation, NostrRocket relies solely on Nostr relays. Contributors propose and approve merits based on their work, ensuring the project's direction and outcomes are shaped directly by those involved. This approach upholds decentralised governance principles and streamlines operations by eliminating the need for conventional accounting and oversight.\n\t\t- Merits are a fundamental component of the NostrRocket project, serving as a quantifiable measure of individual contribution.
