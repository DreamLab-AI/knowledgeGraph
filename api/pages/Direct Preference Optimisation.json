The approach reformulates the reward learning and policy optimization stages of RLHF into a single supervised learning objective by reparameterizing the reward model implicitly through the policy itself, enabling direct optimization on preference pairs (chosen response versus rejected response) collected from human annotators or AI feedback systems. DPO operates by maximizing the likelihood that the model assigns higher probability to preferred responses over dispreferred responses while maintaining proximity to a reference model (typically the supervised fine-tuned base model) through a KL divergence constraint that prevents distributional collapse. The training objective employs the Bradley-Terry preference model to convert pairwise preferences into a contrastive loss function that increases the log-likelihood ratio between chosen and rejected responses, effectively teaching the model to align with human preferences without ever explicitly constructing or querying a separate reward function.

DPO has demonstrated effectiveness for aligning large language models with subjective preferences regarding helpfulness, harmlessness, tone, style, and factuality, achieving results comparable to or exceeding traditional RLHF while requiring significantly less engineering complexity.
