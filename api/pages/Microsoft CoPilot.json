When all these programs were doing was competing with one another to see which RL system could achieve the most impressive game-playing stunt, I has highly dismissive of their efforts. That was a mistake. When they took all of the infrastructure that they had built to build NLP models that we couldn't easily replicate, I started to take things more seriously. And as I dug in to try to understand where all of the capability gaps were between Google and us for model training, I got very, very worried.\n\t  Turns out, just replicating BERT-large wasn't easy to do for us. Even though we had the template for the model, it took us ~6 months to get the model trained because our infrastructure wasn't up to the task. Google had BERT for at least six months prior to that, so in the time that it took us to hack together the capability to train a 340M parameter model, they had a year to figure out how to get it into production and to move on to larger scale, more interesting models. We are already seeing the results of that work in our competitive analysis of their products. One of the Q&A competitive metrics that we watch just jumped by 10 percentage points on Google Search because of BERT-like models. Their auto-complete in Gmail, which is especially useful in the mobile app, is getting scarily good.\n\t  [Redacted]\n\t  We have very smart ML people in Bind, in the vision team, and in the speech team. But the core deep learning teams within each of these bigger teams are very small, and their ambitions have also been constrained, which means that even as we start to feed them resources, they still have to go through a learning process to scale up. And we are multiple years behind the competition in terms of ML scale.\n\t  [Redacted]\n\t  ```\n- ```text\n  From: Satya Nadella\n  To: Kevin Scott\n  CC: Amy Hood\n  Sent: 6/12/2019 6:02:47 PM\n  Subject: Re: Thoughts on OpenAI\n  Very good email that explains, why I want us to do this… and also why we will then ensure our infra folks execute.\n  ```\n- They now have AI threaded through everything from github, to search, and Office.\n- ![Screenshot 2024-05-08 134100.png](../assets/Screenshot_2024-05-08_134100_1715172122220_0.png){:width 800}\n- {{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaCVSUbYpVc}}\n- ## GitHub CoPilot\n\t- They are billing this as the most radical uplift to Windows ever.\n\t- <iframe src=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/05/20/introducing-copilot-pcs/\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 600px\"></iframe>\n\t- Features for workspaces [GitHub Copilot just got exponentially smarter YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZVCJRUADc4)\n\t- [[Microsoft CoPilot]] integration into Office365, first looks [First look at Microsoft 365 Copilot | Paul's Down-Home Page (paulrobichaux.com)](https://paulrobichaux.com/2023/12/14/first-look-at-microsoft-365-copilot/)\n- ## Bing CoPilot\n\t- Now integrated  partially, globally, with Code Interpreter so it can execute code. https://www.linkedin.com/posts/emollick_finally-more-gpt-4-abilities-are-coming-activity-7148155477418278912-Ffdz?\n\t- [Microsoft’s new Copilot Pro brings AI-powered Office features to consumers The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/15/24038711/microsoft-copilot-pro-office-ai-apps)\n\t- ![r/ChatGPT - Is this as good as the standalone ChatGPT 4 for educational purposes?](https://i.redd.it/lgjjtl5j72xc1.jpeg)\n-\n- ## Office365 Co-Pilot\n- # ChatGPT relationship\n\t- [OpenAI Is Doomed - Et tu, Microsoft?
