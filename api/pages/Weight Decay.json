Weight decay (L2 regularisation) prevents overfitting by limiting model complexity and promoting simpler solutions.\n\n\n\n\n## Academic Context\n\n- Weight decay is a **regularisation technique** widely used in machine learning and neural networks to prevent overfitting by penalising large weights during training.\n  - It operates by adding a penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model’s weights (L2 norm) to the loss function.\n  - This encourages the model to learn smaller weights, promoting simpler, more generalisable solutions and limiting model complexity.\n- The academic foundation of weight decay traces back to ridge regression and L2 regularisation, both well-established statistical methods.\n  - It is mathematically expressed as \\( L' = L + \\lambda \\|W\\|^2 \\), where \\(L\\) is the original loss, \\(\\lambda\\) the weight decay coefficient, and \\(W\\) the weights.\n- Weight decay is often conflated with L2 regularisation, but technically differs in implementation, especially in optimisers like Adam where weight decay directly modifies weight updates rather than just adding a penalty to the loss.\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Weight decay remains a cornerstone regularisation method in both academia and industry for training robust machine learning models, including large language models (LLMs).\n  - It is integrated into popular frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, and is a default hyperparameter in many training pipelines.\n- Notable organisations employing weight decay include tech giants and research labs worldwide, with increasing interest in adaptive weight decay methods that tune the decay coefficient dynamically during training.\n- In the UK, machine learning research groups at universities such as the University of Manchester and the University of Leeds actively explore weight decay’s role in improving model generalisation and robustness.\n  - Regional AI hubs in North England, including Sheffield and Newcastle, contribute to advancing optimisation techniques incorporating weight decay.\n- Technical limitations include the challenge of tuning the weight decay coefficient \\(\\lambda\\), which can significantly affect model performance if set improperly.\n  - Recent advances propose adaptive schemes to mitigate this, improving stability and robustness without extensive hyperparameter search.\n- Weight decay is often used alongside other regularisation methods such as dropout, with complementary effects on reducing overfitting.\n\n## Research & Literature\n\n- Key academic papers and sources:\n  - Ghiasi, A., Shafahi, A., & Ardekani, R.
