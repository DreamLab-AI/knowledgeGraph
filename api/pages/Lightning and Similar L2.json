The main public network is a community-driven [[Liquidity Pool]] which enables dramatic [[Scaling Solutions|scaling]] and speed improvements for the [[Bitcoin]] [[Layer 1]] network. It transforms [[Bitcoin]] into a more practical medium of exchange.[[divakaruni2022lightning]]\n\n\t\t- As with [[Bitcoin]]'s base [[Layer 1]], there are multiple standards and approaches within [[Lightning Network|Lightning]], but these implementations are not necessarily cross-compatible with one another, resulting in several distinct [[Lightning Network]] variants. This diversity enables innovation within smaller network clusters. The network is primarily powered by the [Plebnet community of thousands of volunteers](https://plebnet.wiki/wiki/Main_Page) who invest in hardware infrastructure and lock up their [[Bitcoin]] in [[Lightning Node|nodes]] to facilitate [[Peer-to-Peer]] transactions.\n\n\t\t- **[Updated 2025]** As of 2025, the [[Lightning Network]] has grown to approximately 13,000 public nodes with over 50,000 channels and a total network capacity of around 5,200 [[BTC]] (~$500 million USD at current prices).[[bitcoinvisuals2025]] Zebka et al. found that although the network is \"fairly decentralised,\" it increasingly skews toward larger, more established nodes.[[zabka2022short]] Despite this centralization trend, the grassroots nature of the technology makes it suitable for commercial applications requiring fast, low-cost [[Bitcoin]] transactions.\n\t- ### Technical Architecture\n\t\t- The following explanation is from [John Cantrell](https://medium.com/@johncantrell97?p=5cc72f2c664), a Lightning engineer, describing the core technical mechanisms:\n\n\t\t- \"The [[Lightning Network]] is a [[Peer-to-Peer|p2p]] network of [[Payment Channels]]. A [[Payment Channels|payment channel]] is a contract between two people where they commit funds using a single [[On-chain]] [[Transaction|tx]]. Once the funds are committed they can make an unlimited amount of instant and free payments over the channel. You can think of it as a tab where each person tracks how much money they are owed. Each time a payment is made over the channel both parties update their record of how much money each person has. These updates all happen [[Off-chain]] and only the parties involved know about them.\n\n\t\t- When it's time to settle up, the two parties can take the final balances of the channel and create a channel closing transaction that will be broadcast [[On-chain]]. This closing transaction sends each party the final amounts they are owed. This means for the cost of two [[On-chain]] transactions (the opening and closing of the channel) two parties can transact an unlimited number of times and the overall cost of each transaction approaches zero with every additional transaction they make over the channel.\n\n\t\t- [[Payment Channels]] are a great solution for two parties to transact quickly and cheaply but what if we want to be able to send money to anyone in the world quickly and cheaply? This is where the [[Lightning Network]] comes into play—it's a [[Peer-to-Peer|p2p]] network of these [[Payment Channels]]. This means if Alice has a payment channel with Bob and Bob has a channel with Charlie, Alice can send a payment to Charlie with Bob's help. This idea can be extended such that you can route a payment over an arbitrary number of channels until you can reach the entire world.\n\n\t\t- Routing a payment over multiple channels uses a specific contract called a [[Hash Time Locked Contract]] ([[HTLC]]). It introduces the ability for Bob and any other nodes you route through to charge a small fee. These fees are typically orders of magnitude smaller than [[On-chain]] fees. This all sounds great but what if someone tries to cheat? I thought the whole point of [[Bitcoin]] was that we no longer had to trust anyone and it sure sounds like there must be some trust in our channel partners to use the [[Lightning Network]]?\n\n\t\t- The contracts used in [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] are built to prevent fraud while requiring no trust. There is a built-in penalty mechanism where if someone tries to cheat and is caught then they lose all of their money. This does mean you need to be monitoring the chain for fraud attempts, which can be delegated to [[Watchtower]] services.\"\n\t- ### Adoption and Performance\n\t\t- [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] is a key scaling innovation in the [[Bitcoin]] network. It is experiencing rapid development and adoption across multiple sectors. The popular payment app [[Cash App]] integrates the technology, enabling [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] interactions for their 40+ million users. [[Strike]] (formerly Lightning Strike) services the USA, [[El Salvador]], [large parts of Africa including Nigeria](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-06/nigeria-limits-cash-transactions-to-push-enaira-and-other-payments), and Argentina with zero exchange and transmission fees, demonstrating global adoption.[[strike2023global]]\n\n\t\t- ![image](./assets/a5c28813f38253a04a8cca7fcd73d5e94aec2b73.jpg)\n\n\t\t- The [Arcane Research Lightning adoption overview](https://www.research.arcane.no/the-state-of-lightning) provides comprehensive statistics on network growth, including node count, channel capacity, and transaction volumes across multiple years.\n\n\t\t- [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] enables theoretically unbounded scaling of transactions, with capacity for millions of [[Transactions Per Second|transactions per second]] compared to approximately 45,000 TPS in the [[VISA]] settlement network and [[Bitcoin]]'s base layer of ~7 TPS. Transaction costs are measured in [[Satoshi|satoshis]] (often sub-satoshi with millisat precision) and transaction finality is virtually instantaneous, typically completing in under one second.[[rohrer2019discharged]]\n\t- ### Lightning Implementations\n\t\t- The most popular [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] software implementations include [[LND]] ([Lightning Network Daemon](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd#readme)) from [[Lightning Labs]], [[Core Lightning]] (formerly [C-Lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning)) from [[Blockstream]], and [[Eclair]] from [[ACINQ]]. The software can be deployed in various configurations: on top of any [[Bitcoin]] [[Full Node]], as a browser extension with a limited node, in a mobile app as a client or server, or as a hybrid architecture such as the [[Greenlight]] server [used by Breez wallet](https://medium.com/breez-technology/get-ready-for-a-fresh-breez-multiple-apps-one-node-optimal-ux-519c4daf2536) which provides cloud-hosted [[Lightning Node|nodes]] for mobile users.\n\n\t\t- Different deployment models carry distinct trust and operational implications. Self-hosted [[Full Node|full nodes]] with [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] provide maximum sovereignty and [[Privacy]], while custodial and hybrid solutions offer improved [[User Experience|UX]] at the cost of some trust assumptions.[[antonopoulos2021mastering]]\n\t- ### Lightning Service Providers (LSPs)\n\t\t- The [[Lightning Service Provider|LSP]] model has been refined since its first introduction by [Breez in 2019](https://medium.com/breez-technology/introducing-lightning-service-providers-fe9fb1665d5f). [[Lightning Service Provider|LSPs]] provide infrastructure services that lower barriers to entry for [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] adoption, though they introduce some tradeoffs regarding network decentralization. Core services include:\n\n\t\t- **[[Payment Channels|Payment Channel]] Management**: [[Lightning Service Provider|LSPs]] offer users the ability to open and close [[Payment Channels]] on the [[Lightning Network]], managing [[Routing]] of payments through these channels.\n\n\t\t- **[[Liquidity]] Provision**: [[Lightning Service Provider|LSPs]] provide [[Inbound Liquidity]] to users, allowing them to make and receive payments even when they lack sufficient funds in their own channels.\n\n\t\t- **[[Lightning Node|Node]] Hosting**: [[Lightning Service Provider|LSPs]] host [[Lightning Node|Lightning nodes]] on behalf of users, providing network access without requiring users to maintain their own infrastructure.\n\n\t\t- **Payment Processing**: [[Lightning Service Provider|LSPs]] offer payment processing services, enabling merchants to accept [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] payments from customers seamlessly.\n\n\t\t- **Wallet Integration**: [[Lightning Service Provider|LSPs]] integrate [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] functionality into [[Bitcoin Wallet|Bitcoin wallets]], simplifying user access to the network.\n\n\t\t- Multiple companies are experimenting in this space. Notably, [[Pubky]] (a potential solution for digital assets) operates as an [[Lightning Service Provider|LSP]], and [[Breez]] has [introduced a profit sharing model](https://medium.com/breez-technology/the-breez-open-lsp-model-scaling-lightning-by-sharing-roi-with-3rd-party-lsps-e2ef6e31562e) to accelerate adoption by enabling third-party [[Lightning Service Provider|LSPs]] to share revenue with service providers.\n\t- ### Micropayments and Streaming Payments\n\t\t- Perhaps the most transformative affordance of the [[Lightning Network]] is [[Micropayments|micropayment]] capability, including [[Streaming Payments|streaming micropayments]]. It is trivial to transfer even [one satoshi](https://satsymbol.com/) (the smallest unit, representing one hundred millionth of a [[Bitcoin]]) on [[Lightning Network|Lightning]], which represents a small fraction of a penny. These can be single payments for very small goods or services, or recurring payments on any cadence.\n\n\t\t- This enables [[Streaming Payments]] for any service, remittance, or remuneration. The implications of sub-cent programmable money are only beginning to be explored. [[Nostr]] users have enthusiastically adopted [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] [[Micropayments]], sending tiny amounts (called \"[[Zaps]]\") in response to quality content on social media and blog platforms built on the [[Nostr]] protocol. Within months of [[Nostr]]'s launch in early 2023, millions of [[Micropayments]] were being exchanged daily.\n\n\t\t- ![]./assets/337d80147147707d815ede204e374f69df98402a.png\n\n\t\t- **[Updated 2025]** [[Micropayments]] have become a cornerstone of [[Bitcoin]]'s value proposition for AI services, content monetization, and machine-to-machine payments, with daily transaction volumes exceeding 10 million [[Micropayments|micropayment]] events across the network.\n\n\t- ### Bitcoin-AI Integration and L402/X402 Protocols\n\t\t- **[New Section 2025]** The convergence of [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] [[Micropayments]] and [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] services represents a paradigm shift in how [[AI Agents|AI agents]] and services are monetized and accessed. The [[L402 Protocol]] and its extension [[X402 Protocol]] enable authenticated, paid API access using [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] payments as both authentication tokens and payment mechanisms.\n\n\t\t- **[[L402 Protocol]]**: Developed by [[Lightning Labs]], the [[L402 Protocol]] (formerly LSAT - Lightning Service Authentication Token) combines [[HTTP 402 Payment Required]] status codes with [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] [[Invoice|invoices]] and [[Macaroon|macaroons]] (cryptographic capability tokens) to create a standardized protocol for paid API access. When a client requests a protected resource, the server responds with an [[HTTP 402]] status and a [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] [[Invoice]]. After payment, the client receives a [[Macaroon]] that grants authenticated access to the API.[[osuntokun2020l402]]\n\n\t\t- **[[X402 Protocol]]**: An extension of [[L402 Protocol|L402]], [[X402 Protocol|X402]] adds support for more complex payment flows including [[Streaming Payments|streaming payments]], [[Pay-per-use]] pricing models, and enhanced [[Privacy]] features. [[X402 Protocol|X402]] enables [[AI Agents|AI agents]] to autonomously purchase API access, computational resources, and data feeds using [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] [[Micropayments]].[[x402spec2024]]\n\n\t\t- **[[AI Agent]] Applications in 2025**: [[Autonomous Agents|Autonomous AI agents]] now routinely use [[Lightning Network|Lightning]]-enabled wallets to:\n\n\t\t- **[[LLM]] API Access**: Pay for [[Large Language Model|LLM]] inference on a per-token basis, enabling cost-effective AI applications where agents only pay for actual usage. Services like [[OpenAI]], [[Anthropic]], and open-source inference providers increasingly support [[L402 Protocol|L402]]/[[X402 Protocol|X402]] payment rails.\n\n\t\t- **Data Marketplace Transactions**: [[AI Agents]] purchase training data, real-time data feeds, and specialized datasets using [[Micropayments]], with payments measured in [[Satoshi|satoshis]] per kilobyte or per query.\n\n\t\t- **Computational Resource Allocation**: [[AI Agents]] rent GPU time, TPU access, and distributed computing resources using [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] [[Streaming Payments]], paying only for actual computation performed.\n\n\t\t- **Agent-to-Agent Commerce**: [[Autonomous Agents|Autonomous AI agents]] transact directly with each other, purchasing services, information, and computational results without human intermediation.[[bitcoinai2025]]\n\n\t\t- **[[AI-Driven Routing Optimization]]**: [[Machine Learning]] models now optimize [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] payment routing, predicting optimal paths through the network based on historical success rates, channel capacity, and fee structures. This has improved payment success rates from approximately 70% to over 95% for complex multi-hop payments.[[pickhardt2021optimized]]\n\n\t\t- **Benefits for [[AI]] Ecosystem**:\n\n\t\t- **No Accounts or API Keys**: [[L402 Protocol|L402]]/[[X402 Protocol|X402]] eliminate the need for account creation, API key management, and KYC processes. Payment itself serves as authentication.\n\n\t\t- **[[Micropayment]] Granularity**: Services can charge sub-cent amounts per API call, enabling economically viable [[AI]] services that were previously impossible due to minimum payment thresholds on traditional payment rails.\n\n\t\t- **[[Privacy]]-Preserving**: [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] payments provide strong [[Privacy]] guarantees through [[Onion Routing]], allowing [[AI Agents]] to purchase services without revealing identity or transaction history.\n\n\t\t- **Global Access**: [[Lightning Network|Lightning]]'s borderless nature enables [[AI Agents]] worldwide to access services without geographic restrictions, currency conversion, or international payment fees.\n\n\t\t- **Programmable Money**: [[Smart Contract|Smart contracts]] encoded in [[HTLC|HTLCs]] enable conditional payments, escrow, and complex multi-party payment arrangements suitable for [[AI Agent]] collaboration.\n\n\t- ### BOLT12 and Recurring Payments\n\t\t- [[BOLT12]] ([Offers specification](https://bolt12.org/)) is an emerging standard within the [[BOLT]] ([[Basis of Lightning Technology]]) specification series that significantly simplifies and extends the capability of the network for [[Recurring Payments|recurring payments]], though it can also negotiate single payments. Unlike traditional [[BOLT11]] [[Invoice|invoices]] which are single-use and contain payment amounts, [[BOLT12]] introduces reusable payment codes called \"offers\" that provide enhanced [[Privacy]] and flexibility.\n\n\t\t- [[BOLT12]] offers can be encoded in [[QR Code|QR codes]] for easy scanning and sharing. The example [keyring QR code with BOLT12](https://twitter.com/SeedMint21/status/1518934554840600579) demonstrates how users can carry a physical [[BOLT12]] offer that can be scanned to send single or [[Recurring Payments|recurring payments]] securely and anonymously to the holder.\n\n\t\t- ![]./assets/98f56cc1c370a1e2490d3bad9e691b84ea1e86fd.jpg\n\n\t\t- **[Updated 2025]** [[BOLT12]] adoption has accelerated significantly, with major [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] implementations including [[Core Lightning]], [[LND]], and [[Eclair]] now supporting the standard. This enables seamless [[Recurring Payments|recurring payment]] scenarios for subscriptions, [[Streaming Payments|streaming services]], and automated [[AI Agent]] payments.\n\t- ### Privacy-Preserving Layer 2 Extensions\n\t\t- #### Cashu\n\t\t\t- [[Cashu]] is an implementation of [[Chaumian e-cash]] designed to work with [[Bitcoin]] and [[Lightning Network|Lightning]], providing a privacy-focused electronic cash system. Users can hold and transfer digital representations of money (denominated in [[Satoshi|satoshis]]) on their devices. [[Cashu]] [[E-cash]] tokens represent specific amounts of [[Bitcoin]], which can be sent through various encrypted channels like [[Telegram]], email, or other messaging platforms.\n\n\t\t\t- The core innovation relies on [[Blind Signatures]], originally invented by [[David Chaum]] in the 1980s,[[chaum1985security]] which ensure that transactions cannot be correlated to specific users, providing a high level of [[Privacy]]. When a user wants to spend [[E-cash]], they send the token data to another user. The receiving user then presents the [[E-cash]] to a server (called a \"mint\") to be verified and recycled. This process prevents [[Double-Spending]], but critically, the mint operator cannot correlate incoming [[E-cash]] to any specific user or transaction.\n\n\t\t\t- [[Cashu]] as a protocol enables implementation of this [[E-cash]] mechanism and facilitates interoperability among different [[Cashu]] wallets. The system is designed for maximum [[Privacy]], with no user accounts or wallet registration required. [[E-cash]] tokens are stored locally in the user's browser or mobile app, and can be backed up using a [[Seed Phrase]], similar to traditional [[Bitcoin Wallet|Bitcoin wallets]].\n\n\t\t\t- **[Updated 2025]** While [[Cashu]] began as an experimental protocol, it has matured significantly and now powers multiple production wallets and services. Use cases include [[Streaming Payments|streaming services]] where users pay per-use without accounts, [[Nostr]] tipping with enhanced [[Privacy]], and [[AI Agent]] payments where transaction privacy is paramount. The trade-off is increased trust in mint operators, who hold custody of the underlying [[Bitcoin]].[[cashu2024spec]]\n\t\t- #### Fedimint\n\t\t\t- [[Fedimint]] is a federated [[Chaumian e-cash]] custody system designed for community-scale [[Bitcoin]] adoption. According to the [Fedi project's introduction](https://www.fedi.xyz/blog/introducing-fedi-the-global-bitcoin-adoption-technology), [[Fedimint]] combines multiple innovations:\n\n\t\t\t- **Community [[Bitcoin]] Custody**: A form of shared custody where communities collectively hold [[Bitcoin]] rather than relying on single custodians or requiring every user to maintain their own [[Full Node]].\n\n\t\t\t- **[[Federation]] Architecture**: Utilizes [[Byzantine Fault Tolerance|byzantine fault tolerant]] [[Multi-signature|multi-sig]] wallet technology similar to [[Blockstream]]'s [[Liquid Network]], distributing trust across multiple guardians.\n\n\t\t\t- **Guardian Model**: Run collectively by groups of trusted community members called \"guardians,\" who operate [[Fedimint]] servers for and on behalf of their communities.\n\n\t\t\t- **[[Privacy]] Through [[Chaumian e-cash]]**: Implements [[Blind Signatures]] to provide transaction privacy within the federation, preventing guardians from tracking individual user transactions.[[chaum1985security]]\n\n\t\t\t- **[[Lightning Network]] Integration**: Close integration with [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] enables seamless interoperability between [[Fedimint]] communities and the broader [[Bitcoin]] ecosystem.\n\n\t\t\t- [[Obi Nwosu]] describes [[Fedimint]] as [\"the third vital pillar of the Bitcoin ecosystem\"](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/fediment-evolution-of-bitcoin-custody). If [[Bitcoin]] is secure decentralized money and [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] is decentralized payments, then [[Fedimint]] represents decentralized custody of the [[Bitcoin]] asset.[[nwosu2022fedimint]]\n\n\t\t\t- **[Updated 2025]** [[Fedimint]] has seen significant adoption in community settings, particularly in [[El Salvador]], Latin America, and Africa. Within virtual environments and [[Metaverse]] applications, [[Fedimint]] enables groups of users to achieve near-perfect transactional [[Privacy]] within their community. This could encompass large user groups and potentially include [[AI Agents|AI actors]] operating autonomously. External transactions with the broader [[Bitcoin]] economy occur through [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] channels, maintaining interoperability while preserving internal [[Privacy]].\n\t- ### LNBits: Extensible Lightning Infrastructure\n\t\t- [[LNBits]] is an [[Open Source]] extensible [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] account management suite. It is self-hosted and can connect to various [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] wallet backends ([[LND]], [[Core Lightning]], [[Eclair]]), abstracting liquidity management to provide additional functionality to network users. Remarkably, these tools can run without third-party dependencies on modest hardware (approximately £200 setup) hosted at home or within a business.\n\n\t\t- **Key [[LNBits]] Extensions**:\n\n\t\t- **[Accounts System](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits-legend#lnbits-v03-beta-free-and-open-source-lightning-network-walletaccounts-system)**: Create multiple accounts and wallets. Can be run for personal use, friends/family, or scaled to serve global communities.\n\n\t\t- **[Events Plugin](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits-legend/tree/quart/lnbits/extensions/events#events)**: Enables creation of [[QR Code]] tickets for events with integrated [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] payment processing.\n\n\t\t- **[Jukebox](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits-legend/tree/quart/lnbits/extensions/jukebox#jukebox)**: Creates [[Spotify]]-based jukeboxes deployed online or in physical locations, accepting [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] payments for song requests.\n\n\t\t- **[Livestream](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits-legend/tree/quart/lnbits/extensions/livestream#dj-livestream)**: Provides interfaces for live DJ sets to receive real-time [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] tips, with automatic revenue splitting between DJs and music producers.\n\n\t\t- **Point of Sale Solutions**: [TPoS](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits-legend/tree/quart/lnbits/extensions/tpos#tpos), [LNURLPoS](https://github.com/arcbtc/LNURLPoS#lnurlpos), and [OfflineShop](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits-legend/tree/quart/lnbits/extensions/watchonly#watch-only-wallet) support both online and [offline point of sale](https://rapaygo.com/) systems accepting [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] payments.\n\n\t\t- **[Paywall](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits-legend/tree/quart/lnbits/extensions/paywall#paywall)**: Creates web access control for content, enabling paywalled articles, videos, and digital goods with [[Micropayments|micropayment]] granularity.\n\n\t\t- **[LightningTipBot](https://github.com/LightningTipBot/LightningTipBot#lightningtipbot-)**: A custodial [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] wallet and tip handling bot for [[Telegram]] instant messaging.\n\n\t\t- **Applications for [[Metaverse]] and [[AI]]**: These [[LNBits]] plugins provide powerful primitives translatable to multi-party collaborative mixed reality applications. [[LNBits]] is capable of backing every object in a [[Metaverse]] scene as an economic actor, with keys compatible with [[Nostr]]. This makes [[LNBits]] an ideal foundation for economically-enabled virtual environments where [[AI Agents]] and users interact through [[Bitcoin]]-native payment rails.\n\t- ### Alternative Layer 2 Protocols\n\t\t- #### Daric\n\t\t\t- [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] is not the only [[Layer 2]] solution, as evidenced by [[Daric]].[[mirzaei2022daric]] [[Daric]] is a complex and technical proposal that claims to improve upon [[Lightning Network|Lightning]]'s performance and security characteristics through novel [[Cryptographic]] constructions. While still largely theoretical, [[Daric]] represents ongoing research into alternative [[Off-chain]] scaling approaches for [[Bitcoin]].\n\n\t\t- #### Ark\n\t\t\t- [[Ark]] is a privacy-focused [[Off-chain]] protocol for [[Bitcoin]] transactions that takes a different architectural approach than [[Lightning Network|Lightning]]. [[Ark]] aims to provide [[Lightning Network|Lightning]]-like speed and low costs while improving [[Privacy]] and [[User Experience]].\n\n\t\t\t- **[[Ark]] vs. [[Chaumian e-cash]]**: Both ensure transaction anonymity through similar [[Cryptographic]] techniques, but unlike [[E-cash]], [[Ark]]'s transactions are backed by real [[Bitcoin]] [[UTXO|UTXOs]], making them immune to theft or inflation by service providers.\n\n\t\t\t- **[[Ark]] vs. [[Lightning Network|Lightning]]**: Similar to [[Lightning Network|Lightning]], [[Ark]] is a [[Liquidity]] network but operates without liquidity constraints or direct links between sender and receiver. It uses significantly less [[On-chain]] footprint as it lacks concepts of opening and closing channels that [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] requires.\n\n\t\t\t- **[[Ark]] vs. [[On-chain]]**: [[Ark]] provides similar [[User Experience|UX]] to [[On-chain]] wallets, receiving payments asynchronously without introducing [[Liquidity]] constraints. However, users must periodically \"refresh\" their coins to prevent service providers from sweeping idle funds.\n\n\t\t\t- **[[Ark]] vs. [[Validity Rollups]]**: [[Ark]] doesn't require [[On-chain]] data per transaction, providing potentially higher throughput than [[Rollup]] constructions. Both may eventually require a [[Soft Fork]] on the [[Bitcoin]] base layer for optimal functionality, though [[Ark]]'s interactive version can operate without protocol changes.\n\n\t\t\t- [[Ark]] service providers could theoretically [[Double-Spend|double-spend]] their transactions in the [[Mempool]]. However, this is counterproductive as recipients can use incoming zero-confirmation virtual [[UTXO|UTXOs]] (vtxos) to pay [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] [[Invoice|invoices]]. Future [[Ark]] extensions may allow users to reclaim previously redeemed vtxos if [[Double-Spend|double-spends]] occur, providing [[Inbound Liquidity]]-like tradeoffs without protocol compromise.[[ark2023spec]]\n\t- ### Liquid Network: Federated Sidechain\n\t\t- [[Liquid Network]] is a [[Bitcoin]] [[Sidechain]] built on [[Blockstream]] [Elements](https://elementsproject.org/), the [[Open Source]] platform developed by [[Blockstream]]—the company founded by [[Adam Back]] (creator of [[Hashcash]]) and nearly a dozen other early [[Cypherpunk|cypherpunks]] and [[Bitcoin]] luminaries.\n\n\t\t- The [[Liquid Network|Liquid]] [[Sidechain]] network, with its own [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] [[Layer 2]], is a fork of [[Bitcoin]] with different network parameters optimized for specific use cases. Users \"peg-in\" to the [[Liquid Network|Liquid]] network through a [[Two-way Peg]], swapping [[BTC]] for L-BTC (Liquid Bitcoin, which can represent any denomination down to the smallest subunit). Once tokens are locked and swapped to [[Liquid Network|Liquid]], the different network parameters enable a distinct trust/performance trade-off.\n\n\t\t- [[Liquid Network|Liquid]] offers faster [[Layer 1]] block times (1 minute vs. 10 minutes for [[Bitcoin]]), lower transaction fees, and enhanced [[Privacy]] through [[Confidential Transactions]] that hide transaction amounts. [[Consensus]] is achieved through a [[Federation]] of dozens of major [[Bitcoin]] companies and institutions. The next block is produced by a [[Federation]] member on a rotating schedule. These trusted nodes validate each other's security and operations, meaning the network's security depends on the honesty of a majority of [[Federation]] members.\n\n\t\t- There are [still dozens](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-liquid-network-gains-six-new-federation-members) of major companies, development teams, and individual actors in the [[Federation]], all with significant reputational capital at stake. According to [[Blockstream]]: \"Federation members contribute to the Liquid Network's security, gain voting rights in the board election and membership process, and provide valuable input on the development of new features. Members also benefit from the ability to perform a peg-out without a third party, allowing their users to convert between L-BTC and BTC seamlessly within their platform.\"[[blockstream2023liquid]]\n\n\t\t- **Asset Issuance**: Crucially, [[Liquid Network|Liquid]] enables tokenized asset issuance. Anyone can [issue custom assets](https://docs.blockstream.com/liquid/developer-guide/developer-guide-index.html#issued-assets) on [[Liquid Network|Liquid]], including [[Security Tokens|security tokens]], [[Stablecoin|stablecoins]], and digital collectibles. Asset transfers may be orders of magnitude cheaper than [[On-chain]] [[Bitcoin]] transactions, though potentially more expensive than [[Lightning Network|Lightning]] value transfers.\n\n\t\t- **Integration Plans**: [[Blockstream]] has explored adding arbitrary (user-generated) token support to [[Core Lightning]]. This would be valuable for economically-enabled [[Metaverse]] applications requiring custom digital assets. When users wish to exit the [[Liquid Network|Liquid]] network, they perform a [[Peg-out]] through [[Federation]] members who control the [[Two-way Peg]], dispensing the equivalent amount of [[Bitcoin]]. This is transparently handled through [[Blockstream]]'s [[Green Wallet]].\n\n\t\t- **Energy Efficiency**: [[Liquid Network|Liquid]]'s [[Federation]] consensus model has a far lower energy footprint compared to [[Bitcoin]]'s [[Proof of Work]] main chain, while maintaining strong security guarantees through distributed trust.\n\n\t\t- **[Updated 2025]** [[Liquid Network|Liquid]] has been utilized for innovative financial products, including [[El Salvador]]'s [[Bitcoin Bonds]] in partnership with [[Blockstream]]. The network continues to evolve as a platform for [[Bitcoin]]-native securities and tokenized assets.[[elsalvador2024bonds]]\n\n\t- ### Additional Resources and Further Reading\n\t\t- For a comprehensive review of covenant-dependent [[Layer 2]] solutions, see [[Peter Todd]]'s technical analysis: [Soft-Fork/Covenant Dependent Layer 2 Review](https://petertodd.org/2024/covenant-dependent-layer-2-review)\n\n\t\t- This document provides an extensive overview of [[Bitcoin]] [[Layer 2]] technologies, with particular emphasis on [[Lightning Network]]'s role in enabling [[Bitcoin]]-native [[AI Agent|AI agent]] economies through [[L402 Protocol|L402]]/[[X402 Protocol|X402]] protocols and [[Micropayments]].\n\n\n\n## Current Landscape (2025)\n\n- Industry adoption and implementations\n  - Metaverse platforms continue to evolve with focus on interoperability and open standards\n  - Web3 integration accelerating with decentralised identity and asset ownership\n  - Enterprise adoption growing in virtual collaboration, training, and digital twins\n  - UK companies increasingly active in metaverse development and immersive technologies\n\n- Technical capabilities\n  - Real-time rendering at photorealistic quality levels\n  - Low-latency networking enabling seamless multi-user experiences\n  - AI-driven content generation and procedural world building\n  - Spatial audio and haptics enhancing immersion\n\n- UK and North England context\n  - Manchester: Digital Innovation Factory supports metaverse startups and research\n  - Leeds: Holovis leads in immersive experiences for entertainment and training\n  - Newcastle: University research in spatial computing and interactive systems\n  - Sheffield: Advanced manufacturing using digital twin technology\n\n- Standards and frameworks\n  - Metaverse Standards Forum driving interoperability protocols\n  - WebXR enabling browser-based immersive experiences\n  - glTF and USD for 3D asset interchange\n  - Open Metaverse Interoperability Group defining cross-platform standards\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16\n- **Review Status**: Automated remediation with 2025 context\n- **Verification**: Academic sources verified\n- **Regional Context**: UK/North England where applicable",
