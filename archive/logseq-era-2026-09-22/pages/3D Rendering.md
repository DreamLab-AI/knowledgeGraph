  "definition": "3D rendering is the computational process of generating a two-dimensional image or animation from a three-dimensional scene description by simulating the interaction of light with surfaces, materials, and geometry. It encompasses techniques ranging from real-time rasterization used in interactive applications to physically-based ray tracing and path tracing used for photorealistic offline production. The pipeline converts geometric primitives, shader programs, texture maps, and lighting data into final pixel colours via a GPU compute pipeline or software renderer. Contemporary rendering also incorporates neural methods such as Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting, as well as AI-driven upscaling and denoising, blurring the boundary between classical computer graphics and machine learning.",

- ### Definition
  - [[3D Rendering]] is the computational process of converting a [[3D Model]] scene description — comprising geometry, materials, and lighting — into a two-dimensional pixel image or animation sequence. It achieves this by simulating light transport through algorithms including [[Rasterization]], [[Ray Tracing]], and [[Path Tracing]], executed predominantly on [[Graphics Processing Unit]] hardware. Modern rendering increasingly integrates machine-learning methods such as [[Neural Radiance Field]] and AI-driven denoising (e.g. DLSS, FSR), making it a key discipline at the intersection of [[Computer Graphics]] and [[Spatial Computing]]. The fidelity-to-performance trade-off central to rendering shapes the design of every interactive experience, film visual-effects pipeline, and [[Augmented Reality]] or [[Virtual Reality]] system.

- ### Overview
  - 3D rendering is a foundational technology in digital content creation, games, film VFX, architectural visualisation, scientific simulation, and immersive XR experiences. Its core challenge is computationally reproducing the way photons interact with surfaces: how they are emitted by light sources, reflected or absorbed by materials, scattered through volumes, and ultimately focused by a virtual camera onto a pixel grid. Two dominant paradigms address this challenge at different points on the fidelity-versus-speed spectrum:
    - **Rasterization** — projects geometry onto the screen plane and fills pixels with colour computed by shader programs. Extremely fast; powers virtually all real-time games and interactive 3D applications.
    - **Ray/Path Tracing** — simulates individual light rays, enabling correct global illumination, soft shadows, reflections, refractions, and caustics. Computationally expensive; traditionally used for offline film production.
  - Hardware-accelerated ray tracing (RT cores, BVH traversal) and neural upscaling are rapidly closing the gap, enabling near-photorealistic quality at real-time frame rates.

- ### Key Components
  - **[[Render Pipeline]]** — the ordered sequence of programmable and fixed-function GPU stages: input assembly, vertex shading, primitive assembly, rasterization, fragment/pixel shading, and output merging.
  - **[[Pixel Shader]] / Fragment Shader** — evaluates per-pixel colour, incorporating [[Texture Mapping]], BRDF lighting models, and shadow lookups.
  - **[[Compute Shader]]** — general-purpose GPU kernel used for screen-space ambient occlusion, particle simulation, ray marching, and denoising.
  - **[[Depth Buffer]] (Z-buffer)** — per-pixel depth storage that resolves visibility without sorting geometry.
  - **[[Scene Graph]]** — hierarchical data structure that organises 3D scene objects, transforms, and material bindings for efficient CPU-side culling and draw-call assembly.
  - **[[Lighting Model]]** — mathematical description of surface reflectance: Blinn-Phong, Cook-Torrance BRDF, Disney's principled BSDF, or volumetric phase functions for participating media.
  - **[[Global Illumination]]** — simulation of indirect light bouncing between surfaces, achieved via path tracing, radiosity, light probes, irradiance caching, or screen-space approximations such as SSAO and SSGI.
  - **[[Anti-Aliasing]]** — techniques (MSAA, TAA, DLSS, FSR, XeSS) that remove staircase artefacts from undersampled edges and fine geometric detail.
  - **[[Level of Detail]] (LOD)** — substituting lower-resolution geometry meshes or impostor billboards at distance to reduce GPU load.
  - **[[Shader Programming]]** — authored in GLSL, HLSL, MSL, or SPIR-V, allowing artists and engineers to define arbitrary per-vertex and per-pixel programs.

- ### Mechanisms
  - #### Real-Time Rasterization Pipeline
    - Application stage (CPU): frustum culling, batching, draw-call submission via [[Vulkan]], DirectX 12, Metal, or WebGPU.
    - Vertex stage (GPU): MVP matrix transform from model space to clip space; skinning for skeletal animation.
    - Primitive assembly and clipping: assembles triangles; clips against the view frustum.
    - Rasterization: triangle coverage testing; generates screen-space fragments with interpolated attributes (UVs, normals, tangents).
    - Fragment stage: executes [[Pixel Shader]] to sample textures, evaluate [[Lighting Model]], and output HDR colour.
    - Post-processing: tone mapping, bloom, depth-of-field, temporal anti-aliasing, motion blur, and chromatic aberration.
  - #### Ray Tracing and Path Tracing
    - Primary ray generation: one ray per pixel from the virtual camera.
    - BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy) traversal: accelerates ray-triangle intersection tests across millions of polygons.
    - Material evaluation: BSDF sampling determines reflected or refracted ray direction and weight.
    - Russian roulette termination and next-event estimation: statistical techniques to achieve unbiased convergence with bounded ray depth.
    - [[Path Tracing]] yields unbiased [[Global Illumination]] but requires many samples per pixel; Monte Carlo denoising (OptiX AI, Intel Open Image Denoise) reduces noise at low sample counts.
  - #### Neural and Hybrid Methods
    - **[[Neural Radiance Field]] (NeRF)**: volumetric neural scene representation trained from multi-view images; differentiable rendering enables view synthesis without explicit geometry.
    - **[[3D Gaussian Splatting]]**: point-cloud of oriented Gaussians rasterized with alpha blending; faster training and real-time inference than NeRF.
    - **AI upscaling** (DLSS 3, FSR 3, XeSS): convolutional or transformer-based super-resolution reconstructs high-resolution frames from lower-resolution rasterized input, dramatically reducing GPU load.
    - **[[Differentiable Rendering]]**: gradients flow back through the render equation, enabling inverse rendering (recovering 3D scene parameters from images) and training generative 3D models.

- ### Applications / Use Cases
  - **Games and Interactive Media** — Real-time rasterization with hybrid ray tracing powers titles on PC and consoles, targeting 60–120 fps at 4K. PBR material workflows (Unreal Engine, Unity) standardise asset authoring.
  - **Film and Animation VFX** — Offline [[Path Tracing]] (Arnold, RenderMan, Cycles, Manuka) produces photorealistic imagery for feature films and commercials with multi-hour per-frame budgets.
  - **Architectural and Product Visualisation** — Interactive GPU path tracers (NVIDIA Omniverse, Chaos V-Ray RT) provide real-time design feedback for architects and industrial designers.
  - **[[Virtual Reality]] and [[Augmented Reality]]** — Stereo rendering at 90–120 fps per eye for HMDs; [[Foveated Rendering]] concentrates compute at the gaze point detected by eye tracking.
  - **Scientific and Medical Visualisation** — Volume rendering of CT/MRI data using ray marching and transfer functions; molecular visualisation for structural biology.
  - **Autonomous Vehicles** — Synthetic data generation for training perception models; photorealistic simulation of sensor streams (cameras, LiDAR) via differentiable renderers.
  - **Digital Twins and [[Spatial Computing]]** — Persistent, physically accurate 3D models of real-world environments rendered in real time for industrial monitoring and urban planning.
  - **Generative AI Content Pipelines** — Text-to-3D and image-to-3D systems use [[Differentiable Rendering]] and Score Distillation Sampling to optimise 3D representations guided by 2D diffusion models.
