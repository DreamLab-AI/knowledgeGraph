- ### Definition
	- 3D geometry is the mathematical description of shapes, positions, and transformations of objects in three-dimensional space, using representations such as points, vectors, meshes, and coordinate transforms. It provides the underlying spatial data model that computer graphics rendering pipelines and photorealistic rendering engines operate on, from vertex positions through to camera projection matrices. Practical 3D geometry combines linear algebra with computational geometry techniques to represent and manipulate scenes efficiently.
